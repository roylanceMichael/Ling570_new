Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts . => No transitions possible
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . => No transitions possible
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization . => No transitions possible
`` Such agency ` self-help ' borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , '' said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor . => No transitions possible
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC . => No transitions possible
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit . => No transitions possible
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .=>  BOS~`` ``~TO TO~VB VB~TO TO~PRP PRP~, ,~'' ''~PRP PRP~VBZ VBZ~JJ JJ~CC CC~, ,~DT DT~NNP NNP~RB RB~VBZ VBZ~IN IN~CD -25.7342767257
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . => No transitions possible
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years . => No transitions possible
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC . => No transitions possible
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes . => No transitions possible

The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time . => No transitions possible
Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds . => No transitions possible
But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed . => No transitions possible
