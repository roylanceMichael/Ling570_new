Mike Huckabee is heading to Iowa Thursday to be one of the keynote speakers at the Iowa Renewal Project, a private conference for Christian pastors, and leaders held in Des Moines, according to a Huckabee aide. The 2008 GOP presidential candidate also spoke to the same group in 2007. 

Iowa Republicans are abuzz over Huckabee's visit, but the state GOP has had no contact in sometime with the former Arkansas governor, who is still polling near the top of potential 2012 Republican prospects, which include Mitt Romney, Sarah Palin , Newt Gingrich, and Haley Barbour. 

Huckabee came from behind to win the Iowa caucuses in 2008 by double digits over Romney and the rest of the GOP pack, including eventual 2008 Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 

However, Huckabee remains torn over the decision to run for president this time around, according to a close Huckabee source. In previous interviews, he has said he will decide by the summer time whether he will announce his candidacy. 



Mike Huckabee is the host of the FOX News program 'Huckabee'.
