RNC Chairman Reince Priebus and Co-Chair Sharon Day Labor Day Statement 



Washington, DC - Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus and Co-Chair Sharon Day released the following Labor Day statement: 



Today we celebrate the great American tradition of hard work and ingenuity, and we honor those whose work makes our country strong, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. This year, we are also reminded that far too many Americans are struggling for work. Twenty-three million of our fellow citizens are unemployed, underemployed, or gave up on looking for a job altogether. We need a new direction to get this country working again, and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have the plan, vision, and experience to make that happen. 



After nearly four years of the Obama presidency, we are not better off, said RNC Co-Chair Sharon Day. Wages are shrinking, while prices for everything from groceries to gas and healthcare are rising. Our families deserve better, and as president Mitt Romney will deliver.
