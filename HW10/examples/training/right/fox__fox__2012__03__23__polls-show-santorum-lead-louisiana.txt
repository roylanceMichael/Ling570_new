A poll released Friday by Public Policy Polling shows Rick Santorum with a double-digit lead over Mitt Romney in Louisiana. Santorum is the top choice of 42 percent of the 650 likely Republican primary voters polled. Mitt Romney is at 28 percent, with Newt Gingrich at 18 percent and Ron Paul at 8 percent. 

The PPP poll has Santorum winning the support of voters who identify as "very conservative," Tea Partiers, and evangelicals. Romney narrowly has the support, 37-33 percent, of voters living in urban areas. The PPP poll has a 3.8 percent margin of error. 

Another poll released Thursday by Rasmussen Reports also shows Santorum with the lead in Louisiana heading into Saturday's primary. The poll shows Santorum has the support 43 percent of voters, and Romney with 31 percent, Gingrich with 16 percent and Paul with 5 percent. The Rasmussen poll has a 4 percent margin of error. 

There are 20 delegates at stake in Saturday's primary which may be awarded proportionally to the candidate receiving at least 25 percent of the statewide vote. If no candidate reaches this threshold, the 20 delegates will be uncommitted. 

Santorum is looking to extend his success in the Deep South, following his wins in the Alabama and Mississippi primaries on March 13. All four candidates will be holding campaign events in Louisiana on Friday.
