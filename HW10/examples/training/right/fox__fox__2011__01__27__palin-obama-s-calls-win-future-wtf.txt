Sarah Palin says President Obama's recent calls to "win the future" are simply "WTF" moments coming from the administration. 

In an appearance Wednesday on FOX News' "On The Record With Greta Van Susteren ," the former vice-presidential candidate and Alaska governor said the president's State of the Union Address provided just those types of moments. 

"There were a lot of WTF moments throughout that speech, namely, when he made the statement ... that he believed that we can't allow ourselves to, I guess, eventually become buried under a mountain of debt," Palin, who is a FOX News contributor said. "That right there tells you he is so disconnected from reality!" 

Palin also pointed to Obama's call for another "Sputnik Moment," something the president has also alluded to in the past, as another questionable point, saying it is also serves as a warning about America's mounting debt. 

"He needs to remember that what happened back then with the former communist USSR and their victory in that race to space, yes, they won, but they also incurred so much debt at the time that it resulted in the inevitable collapse of the Soviet Union."
