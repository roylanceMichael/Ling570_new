Vice President Biden has arrived in Afghanistan Monday morning in a surprise trip to the region. The White House says the purpose of the trip is to "assess progress toward the transition to Afghan-led security beginning this year, and to demonstrate the United States' commitment to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan." 

While he's there, Biden will meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai, military and civilian personnel and also tour an visit Afghan National Army Training Center. 

The stop comes ahead of a critical July deadline where the administration would like to begin drawing down the U.S. presence there. 

President Obama also made surprise trips to Afghanistan last year - in March and December. 

The last time Biden was in Afghanistan was two years ago when he was vice president-elect.
