Sens. John Barrasso , R-Wyo., and Lindsey Graham , R-S.C., just introduced a bill that gives states the opportunity to opt out of the mandates included in the health care reform bill. It would allow states to refuse the individual, employer, and Medicaid mandates, as well as mandates for levels of coverage. 

Both senators conceded that their real goal is to bring down the health care law entirely and start over, with Graham saying, "The way this bill was passed is the worst of Washington, and I'm going to do everything I can to bring it down." 

Graham said health care mandates will be an issue in the 2012 elections, and he said he thinks the bill will gain bipartisan support.
