AARP says they are not planning any grand membership presentation for President Obama's AARP card when he becomes eligible next Thursday on his 50th birthday. 

When talking about the debt negotiations and Medicare earlier this month in passing, the president mentioned that he was looking forward to the discounts he'd get with the card. 

"I'm going to be turning 50 in a week. So I'm starting to think a little bit more about Medicare eligibility. (Laughter.) Yes, I'm going to get my AARP card soon -- and the discounts," he said on July 15 (which meant his birthday was actually more than a week away). 

"We believe AARP has a lot to offer Boomers and other older Americans, so we understand why the president looks forward to joining, Kevin Donnellan of AARP tells FOX News. 

According to their website, the group says that anyone over 50 can get the benefits of an AARP membership for $16 a year, which includes spouses, so First lady Michelle Obama can get in on the action too. 

Benefits include discounts on "travel, online services, phones and much more." 

The president would also get the benefit of the magazine, and it just so happens he'd see his wife this month. She was just featured in a wide ranging interview talking about her military families initiative "Joining Forces" and how she found out Osama bin Laden was killed. 

AARP also has been actively involved in the debt negotiations, advocating for seniors who might lose their social security checks if a debt deal isn't reached, which the president has said is a fear. 

"In the meantime, we wish the president a happy birthday and hope he will welcome our birthday wish to him and Americans of all ages - the protection of Social Security and Medicare from those who would make cuts to Americans' hard earned benefits in the current deficit reduction debate," Donnellan added. 

It was not immediately clear when the president would receive his card or if it was already in the mail.
