President to Pivot to Real Job Campaigner-In-Chief 



After the President's  "inept" leadership  on the debt ceiling vote, he's rushing off to Chicago tomorrow to do "the other part of his job" fundraising for his reelection campaign. With 9.2 percent unemployment, he could work on creating jobs but I suppose the White House is thinking he should stick to the part of his job he really likes. 

Yellin: The president does head off to Chicago to do some fundraising and turn to the other part of his job which is beginning, working on the 2012 election. 

  



  

CNN's Wolf Blitzer: "Now that they ve got this deal, the president will sign it into law later today. This does enable the president to go as planned to Chicago tomorrow to celebrate his 50th birthday and do some political fundraising." 

CNN's Jessica Yellin: "That s right. The president clearly is ready for a celebration at this point. I would describe the mood here as some exhausted relief, and people actually went home at a reasonable hour last night for the first time in many, many weeks. So the president does head off to Chicago to do some fundraising and turn to the other part of his job which is beginning, working on the 2012 election. He has two fundraisers in Chicago and then he heads back here for further work but of course, all of this will be on the minds of the White House and the issue of how to frame all this going forward into the 2012 election is really about two different visions of government."
