A Lot has Happened Since Obama Took Questions from the WH Press 



The President has gone eight weeks in the midst of the presidential campaign without holding a press conference. In that time there have been two jobs reports, unemployment has risen, and new emails have shown West Wing involvement in scandals that waste taxpayer dollars. Just how long has it been since Obama took questions from the White House press? 

Here's a look at where we stood the last time President Obama faced the tough questions Obamacare had not been ruled on by the Supreme Court Obama had not used executive privilege to hide from Fast Furious The unemployment rate had not risen yet again to 8.3% Eric Holder had not been held in contempt of Congress The Obama SuperPac had not accused Mitt Romney of being responsible for a woman's death We did not know that all 3 Chiefs of Staff had been briefed on Solyndra and had an opportunity to advocate liquidation saving the taxpayers hundreds of millions.  

And since President Obama has been more comfortable talking to Entertainment Tonight and ESPN, here are some references that might be helpful for him  Missy Franklin had 0 Olympic medals and nobody knew about the McKayla Maroney face The Mars Rover had not landed Ann Curry was still co-hosting Today Snoop Lion Was Still Snoop Dogg Kristen Stewart And Robert Pattinson Were Still Dating Lebron James had still not won an NBA Championship Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were together Honey Boo Boo did not have a show on TLC A Spice Girls Reunion was still only a dream
