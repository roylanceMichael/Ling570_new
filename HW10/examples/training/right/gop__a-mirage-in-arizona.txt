Obama Campaign "Has Been Doing A Lot Of Bluffing" On Swing States The President Will Compete To Win, Including "Arguing It Has An Outside Shot At Contesting Arizona."  "President Obama s reelection team has spun multiple pathways to an electoral vote majority, but a glance at his state-by-state approval ratings throughout 2011 suggests the campaign has been doing a lot of bluffing. ...

According To ABC News, Arizona Is "Notably Absent" From Obama's Swing State Victory Fund.  "The fund raised more than $1.3 million in December, the month it was created, FEC documents show.  It dispersed a small fraction of that cash - $5,500 total, in $500 increments - to Democratic Party organizations in 11 states, with much more expected in the months ahead. The targeted states include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- all won by Obama in 2008 but places aides anticipate will be hotly contested in 2012. Notably absent from the list are New Mexico and Arizona, which Obama strategists have said would be potential keys to victory in November and the focus of a robust organizing effort."
