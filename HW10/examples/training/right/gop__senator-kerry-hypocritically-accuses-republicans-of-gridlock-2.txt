Senator Kerry Hypocritically Accuses Republicans Of Gridlock 



Looking to cast blame for the Supercommittee's failure, Senator Kerry claimed political gridlock prevented a compromise with Democrats. Kerry accuses Republicans of clinging to ideology; maybe he forgets that he has voted the Democratic party line 97% of the time.
