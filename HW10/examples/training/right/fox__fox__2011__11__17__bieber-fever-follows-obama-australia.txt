President Obama may be popular in Australia , but his weak approval ratings back in the States got one student thinking when the president visited her high school in Canberra Thursday. 

"Have you ever thought about teaming up with a high-profile celebrity such as Justin Bieber to appeal to more people?" a young girl named Meg asked. 

"You know, that's an interesting question," the president politely replied. 

"But generally speaking, hopefully if I'm going to be successful, it's going to be because of the ideas I put forward and not because I'm hanging out with Justin Bieber ," he said to laughter. 

This isn't the first time the president has been asked about the singer. 

When the president visited a high school computer lab in Skipwith, Virginia last month, he was asked if he knew Bieber. 

He does. 

His answer then was similar to what he told to the student in Australia Thursday, "[H]e is a very nice young man, and I'll tell him you said hi."
