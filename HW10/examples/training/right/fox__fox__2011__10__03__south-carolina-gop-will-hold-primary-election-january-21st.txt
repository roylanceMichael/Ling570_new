After Florida's decision to leap-frog the RNC sanctioned primary calendar last week and set their new date on January 31st, South Carolina has decided over the weekend to hold their presidential primary election on January 21, 2012. 

Statement from South Carolina GOP Chairman Chad Connelly: 

"Last Friday, a nine person committee brought chaos to the 2012 calendar. Today, South Carolina is making things right. 

South Carolina Republicans have a thirty year track record of picking the eventual Republican Presidential nominee. We will continue that historic tradition on January 21, 2012. 

It will undoubtedly be a spirited campaign to make Barack Obama just the worst ONE term President in American history. South Carolina Republicans are united in this mission, and any candidate who ignores our state does so at great peril. 

In conjunction with Fox News, the South Carolina Republican Party will also host a 'First in the South' Republican Debate in the days leading up to the primary."
