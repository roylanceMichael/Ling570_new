MIAMI, Fla. -- GOP vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan ridiculed President Obama Saturday, claiming the commander in chief himself 

said he doesn't have what it takes to get the job done. 

"Just a couple days ago on Univision, President 

Obama admitted that he 'can't 'change Washington from the inside.' Why do we 

send presidents to the White House in the first place," Ryan quipped 

during a rally at the Versailles Restaurant in Little Havana. 

"I mean, we send presidents to change and fix the 

mess in Washington. And if this president has admitted that he can't change 

Washington, then you know what, we need to change presidents," Ryan said 

to a roar of applause. 

The Wisconsin congressman was standing 

shoulder-to-shoulder with some of Florida's most powerful Republicans here - 

including former Governor Jeb Bush - who called the president's comments 

"outrageous." 

Team Obama argues that during his interview Thursday the 

president was really talking about engaging the American public outside of 

Washington in order to initiate the pressure needed to transform big proposals 

into laws. 

It's a message that should sound familiar to Ryan's 

running-mate. During his 2008 campaign Mitt Romney also told reporters, "I 

don't think you can change Washington from the inside. I think you change it 

from the outside." 

The Versailles stop is the first of two rallies Ryan is 

holding Saturday in the pivotal Sun Shine State - where the Republican ticket 

needs to make up some ground. 

According to the latest Fox News polling, President Obama 

holds a five-point edge in Florida -- currently topping Mitt Romney 49-44 

percent.
