#BidenUnhinged for good reason 



You almost can't blame Joe Biden for being so unhinged. It must be frustrating to debate when you have a record that is so hard to defend and not a single tangible plan for the 2 nd term besides tax hikes. 



Some of the real-time reviews of Biden unhinged and Paul Ryan scoring points on debt, Libya more. 



@SamFeistCNN: CNN Focus group loved it when Ryan talked about the debt crisis. Women more than men. #CNNUndecideds #CNNDebate

@AriFleischer : The contrast between cool Ryan and overbearing Biden really hurts Biden. Biden is too hot not effective.

@deucecrew   Me too! RT @AlbertBrooks I actually like Joe Biden even though when he smiles he reminds me of the guy that sold me my worst car. 



@ lynn_bartels  I know Dems are excited by Biden, but I think the interruptions and smiles might be turning off nonpoliticos tuning in tonight. # vpDebate

@jonahNRO: If Biden was advised to be angry at everything he doesn t find hysterical, he s executing perfectly.
