There are scores of corporations, labor unions and municipalities across the country who have some kind bone to pick with the new health care law and are therefore applying for waivers. The Obama administration has approved more than 1,000 exemptions from the year-old law already. 

Now a group called ForAmerica.org is urging its "nearly 1,000,000-person online army" to request a healthcare waiver from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius . The group has an online petition where supporters can "agree we need an individual waiver from Obamacare." The banner headline reads, "Unions, corporations and states are receiving Obamacare waivers. Where is your waiver?" 

Between nearly 860,000 Facebook fans and a significant email list, the group expects close to one million people to sign the online petition. Organizers tell us the petition went live on Monday night and that "so far, more than 4,000 people have requested a waiver from HHS Secretary Sebelius." 

ForAmerica is a non-profit 501(c)4 "organized to educate Americans about traditional and contemporary American values." The group is led by Brent Bozell, a huge name in the conservative movement who is a syndicated columnist, television commentator and lecturer.
