President Barack Obama will make a rare visit to the Pentagon Thursday morning when he rolls out the new military strategy tied to deep cuts in military spending over the next 10 years. 

Officials in the Pentagon say it's the first time any president will address reporters in the Pentagon briefing room. Unfortunately, he doesn t plan on taking questions. 

He'll leave that to Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Martin Dempsey , two men he has worked closely with to devise this new approach to countering worldwide threats. "But ultimately," as one senior defense official put it, "it's the president's strategy." 

"He was heavily involved in the military strategy," this official said, adding the president also met in recent weeks with every Combatant Commander to review it. 

The new strategy is based purely around the roughly $490 billion in cuts to the defense budget over 10 years that Congress decided on last summer. According to those familiar with the report, the future U.S. military will have the ability to fight only one major land war at a time. Any addition battles would have to be fought primarily from the sea and air. 

Critics believe it's an awkward time to deliver such a message, while the U.S. is embroiled in protracted war with Afghanistan and tensions increase with foes such as Iran and North Korea .
