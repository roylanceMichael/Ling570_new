Sarah Palin may not be running for president, but that's not stopping her from visiting the leadoff caucus state of Iowa. 

The Hawkeye State is the epicenter of the political world this week, with the GOP presidential debate airing on Fox News Channel Thursday night and the critical Ames Straw Poll taking place on Saturday. 

Palin, who is a Fox News contributor, is not on the Straw Poll ballot and hasn't said whether she'll run for the GOP nomination. But sources tell Fox News she is bringing her bus tour to Iowa this week, although it's a little unclear exactly when. 

President Obama has a bus tour planned for Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota early next week.
