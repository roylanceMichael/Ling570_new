Among the field of GOP 2012 presidential candidates, some are releasing statements about the situation in Libya . 



Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney : 

"The world is about to be rid of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the brutal tyrant who terrorized the Libyan people. It is my hope that Libya will now move toward a representative form of government that supports freedom, human rights, and the rule of law.As a first step, I call on this new government to arrest and extradite the mastermind behind the bombing of Pan Am 103, Abdelbaset Mohmed Ali al-Megrahi, so justice can finally be done." 



Texas Governor Rick Perry : 

"The crumbling of Muammar Ghadafi's reign, a violent, repressive dictatorship with a history of terrorism, is cause for cautious celebration... The lasting impact of events in Libya will depend on ensuring rebel factions form a unified, civil government that guarantees personal freedoms, and builds a new relationship with the West where we are allies instead of adversaries." 



Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman : 

"The impending fall of Colonel Gaddafi is one chapter in the developing story of a nation in turmoil. Gaddafi has been a longtime opponent of freedom, and I am hopeful -- as the whole world should be -- that his defeat is a step toward openness, democracy and human rights for a people who greatly deserve it." 



Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum : 

"Ridding the world of the likes of Gadhafi is a good thing, but this indecisive President had little to do with this triumph," said Senator Santorum. "The stated task from the very beginning for this administration was to determine whether the US can positively influence the direction of the successor government. As we have seen in Egypt , the euphoria of toppling a dictator does not always result in more security for us and our allies in the region."
