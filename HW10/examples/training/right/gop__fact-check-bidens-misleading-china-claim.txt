FACT CHECK: Biden's Misleading China Claim 



Today, At A Campaign Rally In Ohio, Biden Touted The Administration's Record On China: 

  

Vice President Biden: "We Let Them Know That There's A New Administration In Town ... We Created A New Thing Called The Trade Enforcement Unit."  BIDEN: "The second thing we did, we told China and other countries that they have to start playing by the same rules. Look, we let them know that there's a new administration in town, man. We weren't going to stand by while they engage in dumping goods in the United States while blocking products from reaching their markets. So we created a new thing called the trade enforcement unit, whose sole job is to crackdown on countries that pursue those kinds of unfair trade practices and we're doing it." (Vice President Joe Biden, Remarks At Campaign Event, Youngstown, OH, 5/16/12) 



The Trade Enforcement Unit Was Created Two Months Ago Or Nearly Three Years After The Obama Administration Came To Washington: 



In February 2012, Obama Created The Trade Enforcement Unit.  "President Barack Obama, following through on a promise to beef up enforcement of trade agreements, on Tuesday will sign an executive order creating a new government team to make sure China and others play by the rules, the White House said. The move comes as Obama has faced criticism from Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney over his handling of China and the U.S. trade deficit with the world s second largest economy has soared to record $295.5 billion in 2011. In addition, two new reports on Tuesday raise concerns about state-supported competition from China and call for the United States to take a variety of steps to respond. Obama outlined his plan to create a new Interagency Trade Enforcement Unit (ITEC) in his annual State of the Union speech last month to Congress."
