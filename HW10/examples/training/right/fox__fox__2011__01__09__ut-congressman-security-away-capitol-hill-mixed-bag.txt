In the wake of the tragic shooting of Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz) many of her colleagues in Congress are reevaluating their security policies. Speaking a day after the incident, Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told Fox News he's concerned about his safety, especially when his work takes him off Capitol Hill . Chaffetz described Capitol police as doing an "exceptional job, we are told [the U.S. Capitol] is a top terrorist target and there is adequate security." But back in his home district Chaffetz categorized security as a "mixed bag." 

In the absence of any kind of protection detail, the Congressman has called upon law enforcement officers in Utah's third district to enhance safety at some of his public appearances. Chaffetz said he leans "on law enforcement buddies" and is a "little more comfortable" when they're present at his events. 

It is not uncommon for federal judges to have a security detail, especially if they become associated with a controversial case or ruling. Among the six people killed during Saturday's shooting was federal judge John Roll, who did not attend the event in any official capacity and had merely stopped by to greet those in attendance. Chaffetz thinks something similar to the security detail federal judges are given could work for members of Congress, although important factors including cost and exactly when security would be required remain unexamined at this point. 

While party leaders in Congress have personal security details, most members go without unless there is a specific threat warranting extra protection. Capitol police have advised lawmakers to be vigilant in the days following the attack in Arizona. Congresswoman Giffords remains in critical condition at the University Medical Center in Tucson, where she is in a medically induced coma. A total of 19 people were shot when the suspect, Jared Loughner , opened fire at a "Congress on your Corner" event being held outside a Safeway grocery store.
