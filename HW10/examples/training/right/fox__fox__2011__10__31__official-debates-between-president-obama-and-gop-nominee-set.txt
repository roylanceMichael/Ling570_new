The co-chairs of the Commission on Presidential Debates announced the sites and dates for the 2012 debates that will feature President Obama and the GOP nominee. 

The non-partisan, non-profit commission says there will be three presidential debates and a single vice presidential one all taking place in October of next year. 

The first one will be at the University of Denver in Denver on Wednesday, October 3. 

Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York will host the second debate, which will be a town meeting format on Tuesday October 16. 

The Obama campaign released a statement saying, "The President looks forward to next year's debates. Once the Republicans have selected their candidate, we will work through the details with their campaign and the Commission on Presidential Debates." 

The third presidential one will be in Boca Raton, Florida, at Lynn University on Tuesday, October 22. 

The debate between Vice President Biden the GOP VP nominee will be on Thursday October 11 at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. 

The CPD also released the criteria on who is invited to take part. Participants must to Constitutionally eligible, appear on enough state ballots so that they could win the Electoral College, and hold 15 percent support in five selected national polls. The Gallup organization will be helping advise on the criteria. 

Next summer the moderators will be chosen, which are typically television network anchors. Specific formats and how the internet will be included are yet to be announced. 

There have already been eight debates among the GOP candidates and without the president, which have not been associated with the CPD.
