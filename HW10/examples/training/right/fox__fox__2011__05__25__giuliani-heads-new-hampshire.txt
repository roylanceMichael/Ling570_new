Former New York City mayor and 2008 presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani will visit the first in the nation primary state of New Hampshire next week to gauge interest in a possible White House run in 2012. 

Giuliani plans mostly private Granite State meetings Thursday May 2 and Friday May 3. 

Giuliani insiders in New York and New Hampshire say he is seriously looking into whether he might be able to catch on in the critical early state this time around. In 2008 Giuliani basically skipped the first seven primaries and caucuses before competing in Florida - and losing.
