The White House says President Obama will be deliver a commencement address at Miami Dade College's North Campus on April 29. 

It's the first announcement of what is expected to be many commencement addresses this season, as the commander-in-chief usually hits the college and high school graduation speaking circuit this time of year. 

In fact, the White House sponsored the Race to the Top High School Commencement Challenge again this year, which encouraged public schools across the country to send in applications on how they are preparing students for college. 

The final tally, though, was rather disappointing for the White House. There were only 464 application this year compared to over 1,000 last year. 

The Miami Dade address gives Obama the chance to travel to Florida -- a politically important state, and one that he just visited in recent weeks to promote his message on education and innovation. 

The president typically gives several a year including one at a military institution.
