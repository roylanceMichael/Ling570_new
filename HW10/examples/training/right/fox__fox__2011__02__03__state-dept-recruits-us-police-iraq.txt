Both active and retired U.S. law enforcement officers could soon be serving in new a jurisdiction - Iraq. 

The State Department announced Thursday that the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs met last week with local and state law enforcement offices to discuss opportunities available in Iraq this fall. The bureau hopes to build a team of senior level and expert advisers to serve one-year missions there. 

The U.S. government will assume full responsibility for the development of Iraq's police and border forces beginning October 1, partnering with the Iraqi government to develop management, leadership and technical skill to support the rule of law and maintain Iraq's internal security. 

The announcement comes on a day when an Iraqi government official says twin-bombings killed six policemen and wounded at least 22 people in western Iraq. 

A roadside bomb exploded Thursday evening in downtown Ramadi , the region's Sunni-dominated capital. Minutes later, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-packed vest among the crow of police and bystanders responding to the first blast.
