Mitt Romney released a new web video Wednesday which looks back on his journey to clinching the Republican presidential nomination. It has been nearly one year since Romney announced his campaign for president in Stratham, N.H. 

The video, titled "The Promise of America," features past speeches by the candidate coupled with highlights of campaign events. 

"It's been an extraordinary journey," Romney said in his victory speech in New Hampshire on the night of the Connecticut, Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island primaries. 

Romney, from the same speech, invited Americans to, "join me in the next step toward that destination of November 6th, when across America we can give a sigh of relief and know that the Promise of America has been kept." 

On Tuesday, Romney secured the 1,144 delegates needed to obtain the Republican presidential nomination.
