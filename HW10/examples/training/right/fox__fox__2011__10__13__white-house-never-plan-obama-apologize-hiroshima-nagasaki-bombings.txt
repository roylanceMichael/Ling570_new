The White House says reports that President Obama planned to apologize to Japan for the U.S. using nuclear weapons to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War Two aren't true. 

Though the White House doesn't typically discuss Wikileak cables, an administration official tells Fox News that there was never any plan for an apology and that the president's visit speaks for itself. 

The Wikileak cables suggest that U.S. Ambassador to Japan John Roos told the State Department ahead of a 2009 presidential visit that Obama shouldn't go to the site of the bombings or apologize for them. That guidance, according to the cables, came from Japanese officials. 

But the official says despite the ambassador's advice, the administration never had a plan to apologize for the bombings that led to Japan's surrender in World War Two.
