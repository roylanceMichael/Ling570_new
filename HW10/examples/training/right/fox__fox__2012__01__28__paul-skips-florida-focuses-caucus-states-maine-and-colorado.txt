Unlike the other republican presidential hopefuls, you didn't find Ron Paul in Florida this weekend. Instead, he campaigned in Maine as he continued to focus on winning delegates in states that hold caucuses. 

"We could send a loud and clear message if we can carry this state in the caucuses," the Texas representative said Saturday at a speaking engagement in Alfred, ME, a state where he hopes to win a majority of the 24 delegates it awards on February 11. 

At last Monday's NBC debate in Tampa, FL, Paul commented that delegates are what counts. This strategy has led him to skip campaigning in Florida before Tuesday's winner-take-all primary and instead visit the caucus state of Colorado that day. 

Paul will appear at a series of events throughout the Rocky Mountain state visiting Fort Collins, Denver, and Colorado Springs. 

Colorado holds its caucus on February 7, where it will award 36 delegates. 

Paul hasn't won any of the first three contests, but hopes to tally up enough delegates to win the nomination or at least be a major player in selecting the GOP nominee in case no candidate reaches the 1144 delegates required to secure the nomination. 

Additional states holding caucuses include Nevada, Minnesota, and Washington, among others.
