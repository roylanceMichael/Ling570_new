Mitt Romney's announcement Saturday morning of Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate was going smoothly until the last line. 

"Please join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Paul Ryan," Romney said before Ryan walked on stage in Norfolk, Va. 

Oops. 

Romney corrected himself shortly after Ryan joined him, putting his arm around his running mate and saying he's known to make a mistake "every now and then." 

Romney said he didn't make a mistake by picking Ryan, but corrected his closed line - calling Ryan the "next vice president of the United States."
