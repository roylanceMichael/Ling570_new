Ahead of the president's State of the Union Address, a group of first responders from the September 11 terror attacks gave an American flag to staffers in Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords' office. The flag, signed by 50 9/11 responders, was their way of honoring the victim of of the recent Tucson tragedy. 

Giffords remains in a Houston rehabilitation hospital after she was shot in a rampage that targeted a "Congress On Your Corner" event she was hosting at a supermarket in Tucson. 

The flag was presented to Daniel Hernandez , an intern in Giffords' Tucson office who is credited with helping to save the congresswoman's life when he came to her aid in the shooting's aftermath. Hernandez will be seated with First Lady Michelle Obama in the House Chamber as the president addresses the joint session of Congress. 

The group of 9/11 responders was in Washington to celebrate the passage and signing of a bill that extends health benefits to those who responded to the 2001 teror attacks.
