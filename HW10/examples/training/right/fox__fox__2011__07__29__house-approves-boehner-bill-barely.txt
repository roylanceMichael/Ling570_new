The House of Representatives passed Speaker John Boehner's bill Friday by a razor thin margin, 218-210. In other words, if the GOP lost one more vote, the measure would have failed. 

An interesting note, a number of GOPers who ultimately voted no sat on the sidelines; Reps. Tim Scott (R-SC), Trey Gowdy (R-SC) and Tom Latham (R-IA) Boehner's best friend in the House. 

These were "in case of emergency, break glass votes." Scott and Gowdy were seen sitting on the Democratic side of the aisle, looking at the board and not voting until the R's were sure they had enough. House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-SC) stood right next to them. 

Latham was the final GOP no, casting his ballot right before the end. Latham would have been hard pressed to vote against Boehner, his frequent dinner partner, had push come to shove.
