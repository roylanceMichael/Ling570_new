The girls are at it again. The three eldest daughters of Republican presidential Jon Huntsman have put together a tongue-in-cheek song, teasing their latest satirical work with a Tweet Wednesday night that read, "Spotted: Herman Cain rolling up in style to the Hilton Garden Inn in Manchester with a 6 car motorcade... jamming to this ." 

Their riff on Justin Timberlake's "Sexy Back" is titled "Huntsman's Back." It starts, "We're bringing Huntsman back... The rest of them is one big circus act." It goes on to call out other candidates in part with this, " Herman Cain , we like your pizza, but you can't explain, how 9-9-9 will get us back in shape." And later, "Hey Mitt, what are you gonna say (Romney clip) 'I believe that abortion should be safe and legal.' Tell us Newt, what's your game? (Gingrich clip) 'Mickey Mouse games.' Rick Perry , what's your stance? (Perry clip) 'I stepped in it man.' " 

Known as Jon2012Girls, Liddy, Abby and Mary Anne have made headlines for their sassy Tweets. They used the campaign web video with Mark Block , chief of staff for Herman Cain's campaign, in which he smokes a cigarette to make their own viral spoof ... complete with mustaches and blowing bubbles. 

Jon2012Girls aren't the only ones in the family taking the competition to task. The official Huntsman campaign has unleashed a new web video, " Mittstant Replay ." According to the news release, it "shows the lowlights from Mitt Romney's recent interview on Fox News with Bret Baier and fact checks his false claims." The original Baier interview with Romney has garnered a lot of attention in part because Romney told Baier afterwards he didn't like the interview and thought it was overly aggressive.
