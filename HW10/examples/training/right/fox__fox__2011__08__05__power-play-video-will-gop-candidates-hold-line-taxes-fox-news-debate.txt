Candidates in the 2012 GOP presidential field will face questions Thursday night in the Fox News/Washington Examiner Iowa GOP debate and one of those questioners talked about the candidates with Chris Stirewalt on Friday's Power Play Live. Washington Examiner Chief Political Correspondent and debate panelist Byron York said it's a bit more difficult for candidates currently in office. 

"There are only two Republicans in the field ( Ron Paul and Michele Bachmann ) who have to vote on this stuff," York said. "The others can say they would oppose this and oppose that and they don't really have to pay the consequences." 

And one viewer suggests York ask the candidates if there is consensus that none of them would raise taxes.
