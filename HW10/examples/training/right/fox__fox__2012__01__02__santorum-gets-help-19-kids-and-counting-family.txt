Rick Santorum is getting a tour bus full of help from reality star Bob Duggar. Duggar has rolled into the Hawkeye State with political supporters, 12 of his 19 kids, and their tour bus. 

Duggar, a former Arkansas state representative and star of the TLC reality show "19 Kids and Counting," introduced Santorum at an event in Boone, Iowa, on Monday. 

Duggar, an evangelical Christian, supported former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee last go-around. He says his family prayed about who they should support for the 2012 GOP nomination. When they chose Santorum, the family decorated their bus, gathered about another dozen Santorum supporters from their church, and headed to Iowa to stump for the former senator. 

Duggar's wife Michelle issued a statement of support earlier, saying, "Santorum is a pro-life, Christian conservative with the family values and the common sense business perspective that we need to get our nation back on track, to create jobs and to stand for what is right." 

Santorum has a pretty big family of his own, with seven kids. But that's nothing compared to the Duggars.
