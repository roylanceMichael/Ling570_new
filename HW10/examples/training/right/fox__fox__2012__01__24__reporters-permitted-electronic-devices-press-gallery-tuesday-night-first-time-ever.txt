For the first time ever, reporters can now bring electronic devices such as laptops, BlackBerries and other smartphones into the press gallery for the State of the Union address. 

They cannot make calls and the devices are expected to be in silent mode during President Obama's speech Tuesday night. 

This is the start of a trial period. Previously, all electronic devices were banned. Reporters had to rely on their notebooks. 

This will apply to all garden variety House sessions. This rule change applies only to the House and not to the Senate. 

And, of course, the fact that reporters can now bring iPhones into the chamber means they can now play Angry Birds during the president s speech.
