Last year, Winsome Packer, who works for the Congressional entity known as the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (the Helsinki Commission) field a federal lawsuit against Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Fl). 

Packer still works there. When the Democrats controlled the House, Hastings co-chaired the commission with Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD). 

Packer made allegations of sexual harassment against Hastings. She says that when she took her complaints to Fred Turner, the staff director of the Helsinki Commission, she was threatened with termination. 

Hastings has maintained his innocence all along. 

The Ethics Committee is still tentatively reviewing Hastings' case...although it has not officially launched a formal probe.
