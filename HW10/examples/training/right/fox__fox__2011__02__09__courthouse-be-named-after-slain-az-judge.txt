The House of Representatives voted to name the United States Courthouse under construction in Yuma, Arizona after U.S. District Court Judge John M. Roll, who died in the massacre at a "Congress on Your Corner" event hosted by Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., in January. 

Roll was one of six killed after a gunman opened fire on Giffords and bystanders. 

Southern Arizona has become one of the nation's busiest judicial districts, dealing with a massive influx of immigration and smuggling cases. Roll served as chief judge for the district court before his death, and had lobbied Giffords for additional resources for his court. 

The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl , and passed unanimously in the upper chamber last week. 

The bill passed the House of Representatives 429-0 and now heads to President Obama's desk for his signature.
