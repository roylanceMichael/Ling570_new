Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney met Monday with Afghan president Hamid Karzai in Kabul. 

Romney is widely seen as a likely 2012 Republican presidential candidate and the stop in Afghanistan is part of a larger tour of the middle east intended to burnish his foreign-policy credentials. 

Romney aides tell Fox News the trip will also include a meeting with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later this week but the next stop will be in Jordan where the former Governor will sit down with King Abdullah II. 

Romney was not the only high profile U.S. politician in Afghanistan Monday, Vice President Biden made a surprise visit to the country where some 97,000 US troops are taking part in operations aimed at defeating the Taliban and maintaining the country's fragile democracy. 

Vice President Biden also sat down with Karzai shortly after Romney's meeting.
