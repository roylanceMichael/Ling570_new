Former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty announced in a web video Sunday evening that he is running for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. 

Pawlenty offered what he called a preview of Monday's formal announcement in Iowa in an email to supporters late Sunday. In the embedded video, titled "A Time for Truth," Pawlenty declared, "I'm Tim Pawlenty , and I'm running for president of the United States." 

Here's Pawlenty's email to supporters: 

Dear Friend, 

I wanted you to be among the first to know that tomorrow, I will be in Iowa to announce that I'm running for President of the United States of America. I hope you'll take a moment to watch this video previewing tomorrow's announcement: 

We need a President who will tell the American people the truth about the severe challenges facing our nation and how we can get America back on track. President Obama won't do that. I will. 

After the announcement in Iowa, I'm going to Florida on Tuesday to host a special Facebook Townhall to talk about some of the specific things we must do to solve our nation's fiscal mess. I hope you'll join me in this important online discussion by clicking here to RSVP [link omitted]. 

Together, we will change our country, and this time it'll be for the better. 

Sincerely, 

Tim Pawlenty
