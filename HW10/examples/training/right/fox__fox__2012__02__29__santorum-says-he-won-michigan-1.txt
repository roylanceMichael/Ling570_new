Both the Romney and Santorum camps were in full spin mode the day after Michigan's primary election. 

Advisers to Santorum called the result a "disaster" for Romney and claimed the state's 30 delegates would be split evenly and that the former Pennsylvania Senator had carried 57 of the state's 83 counties. 

Although it was close, Mitt Romney won the popular vote and Michigan GOP officials would not comment on how the state's delegates will be awarded. "We are currently tabulating the final results as based on the new congressional district lines," said Michigan GOP official Matt Frendewy. 

While out on the campaign trail, Santorum upped the ante by saying he "won" Michigan. "We won Michigan last night by coming out of Michigan with 15 delegates out of 30 delegates in Mitt Romney's home state, being outspent six to one," said Santorum while speaking to reporters in Tennessee, where voters will head to the polls on Super Tuesday . 

Romney advisers meanwhile are still criticizing Santorum for urging Democrats to come out and vote in Michigan. 

" Rick Santorum made a colossal mistake by inviting Democrats to come into the Republican primary in Michigan. It may have helped him win the Democrat vote, but he lost decisively among Republicans," said Romney Campaign manager Matt Rhoades. "Republicans should choose the nominee, not Democrats. Rick Santorum needs to apologize and pledge that he won't resort to these dirty tactics on Super Tuesday." 

Romney officials say their man won "handily among Republicans by a 48 -37 margin," also pointing out that Santorum won among those who strongly oppose the Tea Party.
