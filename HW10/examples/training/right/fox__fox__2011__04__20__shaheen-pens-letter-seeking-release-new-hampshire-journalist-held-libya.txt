Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , D-N.H., has written a letter to the Turkish ambassador in Washington, requesting that country's continued help in securing the release of James Foley, a New Hampshire journalist, and three others captured in Libya . Turkey has represented U.S. interests in Libya since the north African nation's recent uprising began. 

"As you know, Mr. Foley and his colleagues Clare Gillis, Manuel Varela de Seijas Brabo and Anton Hammerl, were captured by pro-Qaddafi forces near the eastern Libyan town of Brega on April 5th," Shaheen wrote in the letter. " I understand that Libyan authorities have suggested the journalists will be released, but have not given an indication on timing, and have not allowed outside access to ensure their safety and humane treatment." 

Foley, who is originally from Rochester, New Hampshire, was working in Libya as a freelance correspondent for the online newspaper GlobalPost. The organization reports it hasn't heard from the team since April 5th , but has been told by the Qaddafi government that the journalists will be treated well and ultimately released. 

Earlier in the Libyan conflict, Turkey played a crucial role in the release of four New York Times journalists who were captured by Qaddafi forces. 

"Your government's efforts to secure the recent release of New York Times journalists were greatly welcome, and I am hopeful that Mr. Foley and his colleagues will gain a similarly expeditious release," Shaheen's letter continued.
