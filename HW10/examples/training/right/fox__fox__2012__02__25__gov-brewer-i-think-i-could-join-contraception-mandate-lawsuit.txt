Gov. Jan Brewer , R-Ariz., says she may be willing to add her state to the list of those suing the Obama administration over its contraceptive coverage mandate. 

"I actually haven't seen the lawsuit, but I think I could join in on a lawsuit," said Brewer during an interview with Fox News. 

Governor Brewer says she feels strongly about the issue because she believes in separation of church and state. 

The mandate stems from the federal health care overhaul. It originally required religious-affiliated institutions to offer free contraceptive coverage - President Obama tried to quell the backlash to the rule by instead offering to exempt those institutions, while still requiring insurance companies to provide the coverage directly. 

But as the lawsuits demonstrate, some institutions and states were not satisfied with the change. 

"It's just another point of Obama health care that is wrong, absolutely wrong," added Brewer. 

So far, Texas, Florida, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Carolina have filed suit in a Nebraska U.S. District Court.
