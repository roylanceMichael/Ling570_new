Reports that Palestinians have agreed to unite the rival Fatah and Hamas governments met with guarded optimism from the Obama administration. 

"We have seen the press reports and are seeking more information," said Tommy Veitor, a spokesman for the National Security Council . "As we have said before, the United States supports Palestinian reconciliation on terms which promote the cause of peace." 

But Veitor made it clear that the U.S. still sees Hamas as a terrorist group that must change its tactics. 

"Hamas ... is a terrorist organization which targets civilians," he said. "To play a constructive role in achieving peace, any Palestinian government must accept the Quartet principles and renounce violence, abide by past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist."
