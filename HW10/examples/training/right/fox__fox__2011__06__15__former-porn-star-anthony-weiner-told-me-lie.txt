Former porn star Ginger Lee unleashed new accusations aimed at embattled Congressman Anthony Weiner (D-NY) Wednesday, telling reporters, "He asked me to lie about our communication" at the beginning of the scandal, adding, "I refused to lie, so I went silent and into hiding." 

With power-attorney Gloria Allred at her side, Lee insisted, "I did not sext Anthony Weiner. I did not send photos to him or receive any from him. Anytime that he would take communications in a sexual direction, I did not reciprocate." 

Lee said that Weiner contacted her in March after she began following him on Twitter, and that she remained silent when the scandal erupted because Weiner was someone she respected politically. 

But from there she said things went downhill, and, "Once it go to the point that he lied on national television I knew that anything I said after that would either have to be a lie or an admission, I didn't want to have to do either." 

"I knew I couldn't lie for him, but I didn't want to be the one who kicked him under the bus," Lee said.Allred read several graphic emails she says were from Weiner to Lee, including, "Alright, my package and I are not going to beg. We both see the hazard of going down the path of comparative sexiness." 

In another, Weiner suggested, "You aren't giving my package due credit." 

Lee, now a dancer, concluded, "I think that Anthony Weiner should resign because he lied to the public and to the press for more than a week. It might have never turned into this if he had told the truth but he kept lying. If he lied about this, I can't have much faith in him about anything else."
