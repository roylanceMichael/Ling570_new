After primary victories in Arizona and Michigan, Mitt Romney continued attacks Wednesday on rival Republican candidate Rick Santorum as well as President Obama. 

A new web video released by the Romney campaign Wednesday highlights Democrats who voted for Santorum in the Michigan primary. 

The voters featured in the "Liberal Democrats for Santorum" video offer explanations for their choice of Santorum in the open primary. "It's my way of protecting Obama," claims one Michigan woman. "It's going to throw the GOP into some turmoil," is the reason offered by another voter, also a supposed Democrat. 

Fox News exit polls from Wednesday's Michigan contest show that 53 percent of Democrats who voted in the open primary cast their vote for Santorum. Romney, though, won the contest with 41 percent of the overall vote. Santorum came in second place with 38 percent. 

The new Romney web video coincides with a new fundraising effort to take down Obama, called the One Term Fund. Designed by the Romney campaign, the new fundraising site claims, "our country cannot afford four more years of President Obama." 

In conjunction with the One Term Fund, the Romney camp released another new web video titled, "Kill Romney." Warning of "The Obama Attack Machine," the new video features a portrayal of an Obama campaign strategist setting in motion the "Kill Romney" strategy following Romney's wins in Arizona and Michigan. The fictional strategist writes, "We spent a lot of money in Michigan - clearly not enough," a reference to the strategy of Democrats turning out to vote against Romney. 

Both new videos end with an appeal to donate to the Romney campaign by way of the new One Term Fund website.
