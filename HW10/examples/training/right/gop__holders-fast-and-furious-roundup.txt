Holder's Fast And Furious Roundup 



Today, Attorney General Eric Holder made a series of questionable statements in his testimony before the Committee on the Judiciary in the U.S. House of Representatives about the Obama-botched gunwalking operation known as Fast and Furious. Holder's answers - or lack thereof - raise only more questions and legitimate concerns about how exactly Barack Obama is handling this growing problem at the Department of Justice. 

When asked why the Obama Department of Justice lied to Congress about Fast and Furious, Holder disagreed and said nobody from the DOJ ever lied. When pressed on why Obama's DOJ provided "inaccurate information" and what the difference is between lying and misleading Congress, Holder answered, "It all has to do with your state of mind and whether or not you had the requisite intent to come up with something that would be considered perjury or a lie."
