"Since enactment, one in eight (12%) small employers have either had their health insurance plans terminated or been told their plan would not be available in the future.

Small Employers To "Significantly Change Benefit Packages." "Twenty (20) percent of small employers currently offering [health insurance] expect to significantly change their benefit package and/or their employee's premium cost-share the next time they renew their health insurance plans.  Almost all significant changes expected involve a decrease in benefits, an increase in employee cost-share, or both."

Small Businesses Think That ObamaCare Will Increase Costs, Increase Taxes, And Add To The Federal Deficit.  "By overwhelming margins, small employers who have knowledge of the new law think that PPACA will not reduce the rate of health care (insurance) cost increases, will not reduce the administrative burden, will increase taxes, and will add to the federal deficit."
