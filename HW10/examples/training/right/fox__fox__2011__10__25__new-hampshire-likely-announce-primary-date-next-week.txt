New Hampshire's official primary date will not be set until after the primary filing period closes Friday. In all likelihood, New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner will make his announcement next week. 

Early Tuesday, Gardner was prepared to announce that January 10th would be the date, sources close to Gardner tell Fox News, but later realized several candidates have yet to file for the primary; Newt Gingrich coming in today could have caused a conflict. The all-but-certain date will have to wait a few more days.
