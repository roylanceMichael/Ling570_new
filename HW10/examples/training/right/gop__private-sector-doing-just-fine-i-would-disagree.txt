Private Sector "Doing Just Fine" . "I Would Disagree" 



This Morning,  Former Obama Economic Adviser Austan Goolsbee On MSNBC's "Morning Joe" Today: 



  

MSNBC's Joe Scarborough:   "So you would disagree with Harry Reid, the Senate Majority Leader, who was quoted as saying the private sector s doing fine, we need to focus on growth in the public sector." 



Former Obama Economic Adviser Austan Goolsbee:  "I guess I would disagree a little." 



Scarborough:  "I think most of America would." 



Goolsbee:  "I think at this moment, the government still has an important role to play. It's to get the private sector going. And we can do that with tax cuts and incentives. We can do that with a focus on infrastructure, focus on education. These are the things that s the only sustainable growth that we re going to get, and that s where I am." 



Yesterday,  Senate Democrat Leader Harry Reid Said The Private Sector Is "Doing Just Fine": 





Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV):  "It s very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing just fine; it s the public-sector jobs where we ve lost huge numbers, and that s what this legislation is all about." (Sen. Harry Reid, Remarks, U.S. Senate Floor, 10/19/11)
