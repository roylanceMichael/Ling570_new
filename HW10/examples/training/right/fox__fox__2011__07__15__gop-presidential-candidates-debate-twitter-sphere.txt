Republican presidential candidates are preparing for another debate, but this one s a little different. It will be held via Twitter on Wednesday July 20, in what organizers are calling the First Presidential Debate on Twitter . 

The 90-minute debate will be hosted by a group called TheTeaParty.Net. Organizers confirm Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann , Herman Cain , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson , former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum and Michigan Congressman Thaddeus McCotter will participate. 

Organizers say they are hoping for a very fluid and conversational debate. 

The succinct nature of twitter will force the candidates to provide clear direct answers and the public will see who is providing those answers and the public will see who is just playing politics and providing non-answers, says TheTeaParty.net Coordinator Kellen Giuda. 

The candidates will answer questions submitted via the twitter handle @140townhall and tweet their response in a maximum of two tweets or 280 characters. Organizers also say candidates can tweet links to videos on their websites during opening and closing statements. 

Political Commentator and columnist S.E. Cupp will moderate the debate from Concord, NH and New England-area Tea Party members will comprise the audience. The debate will also be streamed online.
