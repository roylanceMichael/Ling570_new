Now that Texas Governor Rick Perry has officially launched his presidential campaign, Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell will become the new chairman of the Republican Governors Association.McDonnell previously served as the vice chairman of the RGA. 

""It is a tremendous honor to lead the RGA," McDonnell said in a statement. "Thanks to the strong leadership of Governor Perry and the nation's twenty-nine Republican governors, the RGA is in position to have an unprecedented impact this election cycle." 

McDonnell was elected governor of Virginia in 2009 after a campaign that received national attention, as it was one of the first major elections to occur after a nation-wide recession and after President Obama took office. 

As head of the RGA, McDonnell will help support Republican gubernatorial campaigns across the country, giving him an even bigger national spotlight - which would come in handy if he is interested, as he has previously indicated, in accepting a vice presidential slot for the 2012 presidential campaign. 

McDonnell has also, however, said that he is not specifically seeking a VP nomination - only that he would consider accepting if asked - and that his immediate focus is on his gubernatorial duties. 

"I look forward to working with my fellow Republican governors to expand our majority and ensure the RGA remains the most effective political committee in the nation," McDonnell said of his new position. "Republican governors are leading the way in helping the private sector create new jobs, reforming government and getting our economy back on track."
