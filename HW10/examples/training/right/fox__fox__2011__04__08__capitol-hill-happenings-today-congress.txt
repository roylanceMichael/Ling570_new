The official schedule is light, but members and staff will be working hard behind the scenes to find a way to prevent a government shutdown. The current spending bill expires at midnight Friday. 

After three White House meetings in 24 hours, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., and House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio, insist that they have "narrowed the issues" that stand between the two chambers and a long-term agreement. 

However, even if the House and Senate come to an agreement Friday, there still may not be enough time to perform the necessary tasks to prevent a shutdown. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Ky., told Fox earlier this week that he would need "a few days" at a minimum to craft the legislative language for what would be, in his words, "a huge bill." 

The situation at the Capitol is extremely fluid, and a deal could emerge at any time, so stay with Fox News for all the latest.
