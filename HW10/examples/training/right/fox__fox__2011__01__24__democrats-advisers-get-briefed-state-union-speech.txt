White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said President Obama went over a draft of the speech this morning with advisers. Sources confirm to Fox News a number of Democratic voices on television and radio also received a preview. 

White House Senior Advisers David Axelrod and Stephanie Cutter along with Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer conducted the briefing in the Roosevelt Room. 

Those who were in the meeting included: Karen Finney, Peter Finn, Donna Brazille, Brendan Daly, Jamal Simmons, Margie Omero, former Rep. Martin Frost of Texas and Kiki McLean. 

The idea behind doing this kind of briefing is these Democratic operatives often end up being booked as "talking heads" on various TV shows, so it would be wise to give them an understanding of the thinking behind the address. 

The speech is expected to go over five pillars under the theme "How We Win the Future" and talk about innovation, education, infrastructure, the national debt and government reform. 

Gibbs also said in Monday's briefing will be no laundry list of policies, which was reiterated to the group too. 

Also, those at the meeting were told to ask what the GOP plans to do in governing and what kind of cuts they'd do.
