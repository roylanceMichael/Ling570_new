This morning, we ran into Mayor Julian Castro of San Antonio, Texas, on the convention floor. Mayor Castro is getting ready to deliver the Democratic National Convention keynote address tomorrow evening, and he offered us a quick preview of what we can expect to hear from him when he takes the stage: a true American story and a message about the choice we face that he he hopes will resonate with the American people. 

This morning, we ran into Mayor Juli n Castro of San Antonio, Texas, on the convention floor. Mayor Castro is getting ready to deliver the Democratic National Convention keynote address tomorrow evening, and he offered us a quick preview of what we can expect to hear from him when he takes the stage: a true American story and a message about the choice we face that he he hopes will resonate with the American people. 

"I m going to be talking about America as a land of opportunity, using my family story as an American Dream story. I m going to talk about how President Obama is making the investments we need to make right now to sustain the middle class. 

"There is a clear choice between President Obama, who has invested in the middle class, and Gov. Romney, who would take us back to the policies we had just a few years ago that give short shrift to the middle class. 

"But right now, I m just trying to soak it all in." 

And tomorrow, if you think you re seeing double on stage, you re not. Mayor Castro s identical twin brother, Joaquin, a Texas state representative who is running for Congress this fall, will be up on the convention stage introducing his brother to the American people. 

"The place we come from in San Antonio," says Rep. Castro, "is full of hardworking, humble people. I m proud to tell the American people how my brother is helping folks achieve the American Dream there." 



Tune in to the Convention tomorrow night on TV or on DemConvention.com s livestream to hear both Castros address the Democratic National Convention.
