The U.S. Department of Labor is proposing a new rule requiring federal contractors and subcontracts to set a hiring goal of having 7 percent of their workforces be peoples with disabilities. This proposed rule would strengthen the affirmative action requirements established in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 503 which obligates federal contractors and subcontractors to ensure equal employment opportunities for qualified workers with disabilities. 

Under this new rule the department s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs will define specific goals contractors will have to meet as well as detailing specific actions contractors must take in the areas of recruitment, training, record keeping and policy discrimination as well as providing specific guidance on how to comply with the law.
