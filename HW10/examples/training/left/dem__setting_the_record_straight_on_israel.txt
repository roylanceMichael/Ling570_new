If anyone doubted the resolve of the Jewish community of Montgomery Country, Pennsylvania, to show support for President Obama, all you needed to do was show up at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel in Elkins Park on Monday evening. 

More than 1,200 people gathered with Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to applaud President Obama s record and support his reelection. 

The enthusiasm was palpable throughout the evening. Pennsylvania s own Rep. Allyson Schwartz introduced her friend and colleague, Rep. Wasserman Schultz, who set the record straight on President Obama s accomplishments and shared the numerous achievements of this administration, from the Affordable Care Act to the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. 

Over cheers of "four more years!" from the standing-room only crowd, she emphasized President Obama s strong and unwavering support of and commitment to Israel s security. This president has raised U.S. security assistance to unprecedented levels, increased military cooperation, and supported Israel s Iron Dome system. 

President Obama has been a reliable friend of Israel, and it was clear from this evening that the Jewish community will support him in this election.
