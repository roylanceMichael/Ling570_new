This happened on Friday, to little fanfare : 

The American military says it has completed what it called the recovery, meaning withdrawal, of the 33,000 surge troops it had sent to Afghanistan two years ago, more than a week ahead of the Sept. 30 deadline President Obama set for them to go home. 

Here a few more numbers to keep in mind as we approach the 2014 deadline for withdrawal of US combat forces: 

68,000 : The number of US troops still stationed in Afghanistan. 

117,227 : The total number of Department of Defense contractors working in Afghanistan. 

34,765 : The number of US citizens working as contractors in Afghanistan. 

9,355 : The number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan since Obama took office. 

18,553 : The total number of civilian casualties since the war started. 

1491 : The number of US troop casualties in Afghanistan since Obama took office. 

2121 : The total number of US troop casualties since the war started. 

$385,600,000,000 : The estimated financial cost of the war in Afghanistan to the US taxpayer since Obama took office. 

$557,300,000,000 : The estimated financial cost of the war in Afghanistan to the US taxpayer since October 7, 2001 .
