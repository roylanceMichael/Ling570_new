Soldiers with 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, walk in what could be mistaken for another planet. Once the Chinook helicopter dropped the Soldiers off at Forward Operating Base Pacemaker, it immediately flew away causing the loose dirt and dust to fly into the air. (US Army photo by Sgt.
