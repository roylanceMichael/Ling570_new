Who said the following about Mitt Romney? 

"The governor of Massachusetts is totally consistent, because he s had two positions at least on every issue." 

"I didn t manage for profit. I led for patriotism." 

"For the upcoming 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, that bill to American taxpayers is estimated to be $1.3 billion. That s outrageous and it s a disgrace." 

That s fellow Republican and current Romney endorser John McCain. Romney and McCain haven t always had the sunniest of friendships, and McCain has not shied away from hitting Romney on his record as governor, his time in the private sector, and his values. And today, he introduced Mitt at an RNC gathering in Arizona. 

Regardless of what McCain says these days, we know what he really thinks. Check out our latest video, "John McCain on Mitt Romney."
