9:40 p.m. Central time: Gov. Scott Walker is the projected winner of Tuesday's historic gubernatorial recall election in Wisconsin. News outlets called the race for Walker less than an hour after polls closed. Walker led his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, 58 percent to 41 percent with half of precincts reported across the state. Read more here . 

8:32 p.m. Central time: To the ire of Democrats and labor officials, the role scandal-plagued Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus will play in tonight's election operations remains in doubt. The Journal Sentinel reports : 

While Waukesha County Executive Dan Vrakas and his chief of staff insisted Tuesday that County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus was not the one in charge of election duties for the recall election, she appeared to be at the helm. 

Nickolaus refused to respond to questions in her office, turning her back and closing her office door while a reporter waited at a service counter. Her deputy, Kelly Yaeger, didn't respond, either. 

Nickolaus was observed passing out election supplies to local clerks leading up to Tuesday's election, and she's the one who fielded questions Tuesday from the field, said Gina Kozlik, Waukesha's deputy clerk-treasurer. 

Shawn Lundie, Vrakas' chief of staff, said he was confident procedures put in place with Yaeger would ensure smooth reporting of votes Tuesday night. He also said Yaeger, while fully competent, was free to ask Nickolaus to assist her. 

Vrakas, for his part, added that Nickolaus agreed to step aside and hand off her duties to Kelly (Yaeger), and that has occurred.

7:25 p.m. Central time: Wisconsinites who turned out to vote in Tuesday's recall elections for Gov. Scott Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, and four GOP state senators were split almost evenly by party identification, according to CNN exit polls . Thirty-five percent said they were Democrats and 33 percent identified themselves as Republicans. Thirty-two percent described themselves as independents. 

Nine out of ten voters, exit polls found, said they'd made up their minds about how to vote in the recall elections prior to May. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett , Walker's opponent, won the recall's Democratic primary on May 8. Just seven percent of voters said they decided how to vote in the recalls on Election Day.
