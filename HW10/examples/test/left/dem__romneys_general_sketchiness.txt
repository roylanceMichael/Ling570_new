This morning, Romney s top adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, confirmed what we ve known to be true all along: Mitt Romney has no core and no real political beliefs he ll say whatever it takes to get elected. 

Here s Fehrnstrom s verbatim quote: "Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again." 

Romney has a lot of shaking to do on his Etch A Sketch because statements like "Let Detroit go bankrupt" and vows to "get rid of" Planned Parenthood tend to leave a lasting mark.
