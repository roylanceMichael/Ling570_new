Good news, conservatives! If the Republican National Convention gets a little too stressful, you can always unwind gratis in Tampa Bay's only gay owned and gay operated, private club, resort bathhouse. From now until August 31, the Ybor Resort and Spa, located in the heart of Tampa's sultry Ybor City party district, is offering a super promotion: ALL RNC DELEGATES GET IN FREE! Tea party, anyone? 

All guys 18 up are welcome to sample Ybor's recently opened steam room, not to mention the spa's brand-spanking new dark room, dubbed A Shot In The Dark. Just bear in mind the house rules : It's a private men's health club; no drugs, pets, or prostitution; and always wear your towel!
