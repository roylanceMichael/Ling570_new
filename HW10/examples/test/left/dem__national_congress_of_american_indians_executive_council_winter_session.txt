Last week the National Congress of American Indians Executive Council held their 2012 winter session, focusing on legislative issues and the Obama administration s 2012 agenda. While there, attendees heard from a variety of speakers including EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson and the Commerce Department s John Bryson. Both Jackson and Bryson spoke of their long and successful relationship with Indian Nation, the various joint programs the EPA and Department of Commerce are implementing with Indian Country, and the important steps their organizations are taking to help Indian Country s economies. 

Jackson talked about how tribes from Maine to Alaska are becoming drivers for a green economy," and cited tribes such as the Spokane s work to promote economic development programs and the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash in California, who are conducting job training and supporting green jobs for tribal members and the broader community. She also highlighted the EPA s Tribal ecoAmbassador Program that works with tribes to provide funding and technical support to tribal colleges and universities so they can work with their students to address challenges in their individual communities. 

Similarly, Bryson spoke about how his every day is spent "putting Americans back to work and helping American businesses and communities continue to create jobs and how at the Commerce Department, we have a host of programs where Commerce and Native American communities are working together to bring jobs and opportunities to Indian country. Specifically he mentioned the Native American Business Enterprise Centers based in seven states across the country as well as the Rural Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge which is focused on spurring economic growth through public-private partnerships. 

Both Jackson and Bryson committed the EPA and Department of Commerce to following the example of the Obama administration and working to ensure a strong partnership with Indian Country both now and in the future.
