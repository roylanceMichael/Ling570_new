Chris Stirewalt discusses a proposal by the Obama Administration that would tack a 15 cent tax onto every Christmas tree sold across the country this holiday season. 

Chris also talks with Utah Senator Mike Lee (R) about Fannie May and Freddie Mac requesting $7.8 billion to cover their losses over the past three months.
