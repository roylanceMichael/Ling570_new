Chris Christie, in a brief interview with Fox News, defended Mitt Romney over his comments on people who don't pay federal income taxes viewing themselves as "victims" who deserve something from the government. 

Romney wants to "empower individuals ... and that's what he's really talking about," Christie, the New Jersey governor, said. "He believes that every American has got to have skin in the game. ... He doesn't want what the president wants (in terms of larger government)." 

Asked whether this controversy will hurt Romney, Christie said, "I think you guys will want to talk about it for a day or two and then we're gonna move on to the issues that the people of this country really care about," which are how to get more people working and earning more. 

Few Republicans have criticized Romney publicly on the subject, but there also hadn't been many public defenders until Christie.
