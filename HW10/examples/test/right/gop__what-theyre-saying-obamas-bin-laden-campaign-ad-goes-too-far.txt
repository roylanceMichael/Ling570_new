WHAT THEY'RE SAYING: OBAMA'S BIN LADEN CAMPAIGN AD GOES TOO FAR 



Obama's Decision To Use The Bin Laden Raid In A Campaign Ad Has Ignited Criticism That He Is "Inappropriately Politicizing A Grave Matter Of National Security."  "The Obama campaign s bin Laden ad, which has stirred a fierce debate, looks to some like a hit below the belt, using a questionable premise to make a political argument that Democrats can be just as tough in dealing with the nation s enemies as Republicans. Critics, including Huffington Post Media Group Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington, have said President Barack Obama is inappropriately politicizing a grave matter of national security."

The   Wall Street Journal  Questioned Obama's Attempt To Turn The Bin Laden Raid "Into A Wedge Issue."  "Is Barack Obama trying to become the most polarizing President since Richard Nixon? That seems unlikely since he s running for re-election, but his campaign s latest stunt of turning the killing of Osama bin Laden into a wedge issue has to make you wonder."

The Washington Examiner : "With His Chances At A Second Term Increasingly Uncertain," Obama Has Resorted To "Vulgar Political Boasting" About The Bin Laden Raid.  "Sadly, the quiet dignity and restraint of last May gave way to this April s vulgar political boasting. With his chances at a second term increasingly uncertain, Obama s campaign has begun hyping the bin Laden raid. The most overt instance is its release of an ad extolling Obama s decision, with Bill Clinton as narrator and featuring multiple pensive images of the commander in chief."

The Washington Post 's  Dana Milbank Called Obama's Bin Laden Campaign Ad "Sleazy."  "The preezy of the United Steezy is making me queasy. I'm not troubled by President Obama's slow jam with Jimmy Fallon, who dubbed the commander in chief 'preezy' during Obama's appearance on late-night TV. No, preezy is making me queasy because his nonstop campaigning is looking, well, sleazy -- and his ad suggesting that Mitt Romney wouldn't have killed Osama bin Laden is just the beginning of it." (Dana Milbank, Op-Ed. "President Obama, Campaigner In Chief,"  The Washington Post , 4/20/12) 

The Huffington Post 's Arianna Huffington Criticized Obama's Bin Laden Campaign Video As "One Of The Most Despicable Things You Can Do ."

All that is perfectly legitimate,' she said on CBS 'This Morning.' 'But to turn it into a campaign ad is one of the most despicable things you can do.'
