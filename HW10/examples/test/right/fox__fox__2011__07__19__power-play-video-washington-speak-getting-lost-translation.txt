Someone said recently that there are no arbiters of reality anymore in Washington, which makes it very difficult for the American people to comprehend the direness of any given political situation. 

Nowhere is the divide between Washington and reality so distant than in the current debt ceiling extension debate looming ever larger day by day on Capitol Hill . 

Chances for a deal are evaporating in the sweltering heat of deadline negotiations, notes Fox News' Chris Stirewalt in Tuesday's edition of Power Play . Even though the Senate's Gang of Six is back together , Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked over spending cuts and revenue increases. On top of that, there's disagreement over a contingency plan by Senate leaders Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell that would give President Obama limited authority to raise the debt ceiling in increments blocked only by a 2/3 vote in the House and Senate. 

Each side of the aisle in both chambers is pushing their plan as better than the rest, and both parties risk seeing the message that a default could have real life impact get lost in translation to average Americans. 

On Power Play Live, Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said Speaker John Boehner's attempt to pass a Cap, Cut and Balance bill through the Republican controlled House is disingenuous at best. Ryan says Boehner knows the bill won't go anywhere.
