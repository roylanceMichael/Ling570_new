The White House Monday released the 2010 financial disclosure reports for President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , showing the two are still profiting from their book publications. 

By far, the president's largest percentage of income stems from book royalties. President Obama earned between $1 and $5 million from sales of his memoir, "Dreams from My Father." Due to the nature of the forms, exact figures are not available and all assets are listed in ranges, making it difficult to accurately pin point a figure. The assets of the first family are estimated as high as $12 million. 

After book sales, the president's other resources include treasury notes also in the $1 to $5 million bracket, with retirement funds and college savings plans for his daughters completing his disclosure report. The Obama's report lists no liabilities. 

Vice President Biden wasn't as successful in book sales last year, with his share of proceeds from the autobiography "Promises to Keep" garnering less than $201. Biden's other assets include his property in Wilmington, Del., a rental listed at a value between $100,001 and $250,000, as well as checking, savings, various investments and several life insurance policies. The vice president also lists several liabilities, including a home equity line of credit between $100,001 and $250,000. 

The full copies of the disclosure forms for President Obama and Vice President Biden are available on the White House website . The White House says staffers of the administration will release their disclosure forms next month.
