At a fundraiser in Connecticut, President Obama unveiled a new attack line on his opponent Mitt Romney s tax plans, calling him Romney Hood, or Robin Hood in reverse. 

Obama often chides his rival s proposal as only helping the top and expecting everyone else to fend for themselves, but the president gave it a new twist Monday, harkening back to the legendary medieval English folk hero known for stealing from the rich and giving it the poor. 

Obama cited a Tax Policy Center study, saying Romney would effectively raise taxes on middle-class families with children by an average of $2,000 -- to pay for this tax cut. Not to reduce the deficit. ... He d ask the middle class to pay more in taxes so that he could give another $250,000 tax cut to people making more than $3 million a year. 

The audience booed, and then he delivered his new applause line: "It's like Robin Hood in reverse. It's Romney Hood." 

The Romney camp fired back, saying Obama is the one in the race who will raise taxes. 

President Obama recently said the biggest regret of his first term was not telling better stories. He s trying to make up for it now, but his stories just aren t true. There s only one candidate in this race who s going to raise taxes on the American people and that s Barack Obama, said Ryan Williams, a Romney campaign spokesman. 

While he s used taxpayer dollars to grow government and reward his donors, middle-class Americans have seen fewer jobs, lower incomes and less hope for the future. Mitt Romney has a plan for a stronger middle class and, unlike President Obama, a record of accomplishment behind it, Williams added. 

Obama was in Connecticut for a pair of fundraisers, the first at a hotel and the second at the home of Harvey Weinstein that also included Aaron Sorkin, Anne Hathaway , Anna Wintour and Jerry Springer. 

Obama s being out-raised by Romney, who along with the RNC pulled in about $101 million compared to Obama's and the DNC s $75 million for the month of July. 

At the fundraiser Monday, Obama noted he s expecting to be outspent. "Over the course of the next three months, the other side is going to spend more money than we have ever seen on ads that basically say the same thing you've been hearing for the past three months," the president said.
