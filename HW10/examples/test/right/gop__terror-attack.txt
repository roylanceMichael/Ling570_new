The Washington Post 's Fact Checker: Obama "Did Not Say 'Terrorism'--And It Took The Administration Days To Concede That That It An 'Act Of Terrorism' That Appears Unrelated To Initial Reports Of Anger At A Video That Defamed The Prophet Muhammad." "What did Obama say in the Rose Garden a day after the attack in Libya? 'No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this nation,' he said. But he did not say 'terrorism'--and it took the administration days to concede that that it an 'act of terrorism' that appears unrelated to initial reports of anger at a video that defamed the prophet Muhammad." (Glenn Kessler, "Fact Check: Libya Attack," The Washington Post s Fact Checker , 10/16/12) In Obama's Rose Garden Remarks, "He Did Not Explicitly Refer To The Benghazi Attack As An 'Act Of Terror,' Though He Did Use Those Words." "Romney said during Tuesday night s debate that it took 14 days for Obama to acknowledge that the attack was a terrorist attack, while Obama and CNN's Candy Crowley agreed that Obama said so Sept. 12 in remarks in the Rose Garden. In those remarks, journalists noticed, he did not explicitly refer to the Benghazi attack as an 'act of terror,' though he did use those words. 'No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for,' he said." (Josh Rogin, "Obama Did Call Benghazi Attack 'An Act Of Terror In Colorado," Foreign Policy s The Cable , 10/16/12) Charlotte, NC WSOC's @BlairMiller9 : "And more on that Rose Garden transcript: It s 801 words long...the word 'terror'--mentioned once." (Blair Miller, Twitter Feed , 10/16/12) Weekly Standard's @StephenHayes : Everyone after the debate is talking about Libya. Romney s answer wasn t clean, but more talk about Libya is not good for the Obama campaign 

  Fox News' @Ed Henry : "Note POTUS said 'actS of terror' in general, not terror attack RT @jamiedupree President's remarks on Libya Sept."
