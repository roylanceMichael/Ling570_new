UPDATE: Whoops! Just two days after endorsing GOP candidate and marijuana legalization proponent Gary Johnson , Willie Nelson changed his mind. Steve, on The Teapot Party blog , explains what happened. 

"Yesterday, both the Teapot Party and Gary Johnson 2012 sent out press releases announcing the endorsement. The media immediately jumped on it, with Politico, Fox and Raw Story leading the coverage. We were on a roll. But not so fast. I sent the press release and coverage links to Nelson. His response took me by surprise: My position is it too early for me to endorse anyone. And I think everyone should vote their own conscience.' I wrote back reminding him that he had approved the endorsement. I know I said that,' Nelson replied. But I think I will wait and see where he stands on other things. My bad. Sorry.'" 

Perhaps when Nelson made the endorsement he was either "Crazy," or, dare I say it, smoking something funny?

Presidential candidate Gary Johnson is fired up about an endorsement from country music legend Willie Nelson and the Teapot Party. 

According to a Johnson campaign press release , "The endorsement comes following a meeting between Johnson and Nelson last week, and marks the first presidential endorsement for the Teapot Party." 

In case you're wondering what kind of tea Willie is brewing at his party, the organization's website explains that Nelson co-founded the group to promote marijuana legalization after his arrest for possession last November. The former Highwayman is quoted on the site explaining, "The purpose of the Teapot Party is to vote in people who believe the way we do and vote out the ones who don't." 

Johnson is well known for advocating marijuana legalization and his opposition to the War on Drugs, which he views as a ganja-sized waste of taxpayer dollars -- a view he articulated in the first GOP debate, hosted by Fox News. 

"Half of what we spend on law enforcement, the courts and the prisons is drug-related," the former New Mexico Governor explained. "And to what end? Ninety percent of the drug problem is prohibition related, not use related. So I advocate legalizing marijuana. Control it. Regulate it. Tax it." 

In his press release Johnson says. "I am truly gratified to have the endorsement of such a legendary entertainer and champion for individual rights as Willie Nelson . Not only is Willie a superstar talent but, he is a strong advocate for social change, as seen through his tireless work on behalf of family owned farms and hard working Americans. People across this country are demanding the freedom and opportunity to pursue their dreams without interference from a heavy-handed government, and Willie and I stand together to lend our voices to those demands." 

Johnson was the first candidate to formally announce his run for the Republican presidential nomination. But with several higher profile candidates now entering the race, the libertarian-leaning candidate is surely happy to get any support he can, even from a Red Headed Stranger.
