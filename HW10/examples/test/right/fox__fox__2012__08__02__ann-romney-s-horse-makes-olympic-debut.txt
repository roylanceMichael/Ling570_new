The worlds of politics and sports intersected in London Thursday morning as Rafalca Romney, a horse part owned by Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's wife Ann, made her Olympic debut today, competing in the Equestrian sport of Dressage. 

Ridden by Jan Ebeling, the 15-year-old mare received a 70.213 for her performance, earning standing cheers from Mrs. Romney and her co-owners. Rafalca currently stands in 13th place, with another 25 horses, including 3 more from the US, competing Friday. It's still too early to tell if the score is good enough to advance to the medal rounds. 

In an interview with the Associated Press after the competition, Ann Romney said she was "thrilled to death" with the performance. 

"She was consistent and elegant. She did not disappoint," Mrs. Romney continued. 

Dressage, better known as horse ballet, has been relatively unknown before this year in the United States, despite celebrating its 100th year as an Olympic competition. 

It has caused waves in the political landscape, as Democrats tried to use the sport as a way to paint Mitt Romney as out of touch with regular Americans. 

Dressage was also declared the "sport of the summer" by Steven Colbert.
