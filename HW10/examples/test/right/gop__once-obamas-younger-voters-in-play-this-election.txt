Once Obama's, younger voters in play this election 



President Obama is on his way to Iowa this morning - the last stop on his three state college campaign swing on the taxpayer dime. The AP details why Obama is so worried - polling and registration shows young voters are in play this election after the president won the demographic by 34 points in 2008. In fact, Republicans have narrowed or overtaken the registration gap with young voters in all three states Obama campaigned in this week. 

This was also on display yesterday in North Carolina where the students told the Raleigh News Observer  the excitement for Obama has "fizzled." 

Republicans are going to aggressively campaign for young voters who remain unemployed and underemployed after Obama's Hope and Change promises failed. - Kirsten
