MIAMI-- Attending a Tea Party rally Friday in Orlando, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio tore into President Barack Obama for giving what he described as a campaign speech earlier this week instead of issuing a genuine budget plan. 

" The president the other day didn't offer a budget, he offered a speech, a partisan speech, it was a campaign speech," Rubio said to a FOX Orlando reporter after the junior senator spoke to thousands of cheering Florida Tea Partyists. 

"He has to lead. These generational issues that our country faces can't be solved unless the president leads and he doesn't want to lead, he'd rather get re-elected than solve our problems, and I think that's a mistake," Rubio added.
