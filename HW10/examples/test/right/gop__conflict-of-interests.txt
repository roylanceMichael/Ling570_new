Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) Expressed His "Outrage" At Freddie's Practice Which Is "In Direct Opposition To A Policy Recommendation That Is Widely Viewed To Be Essential To Our Recovery ."  "I am writing to express my outrage at recent NPR reports about the investment practices of Freddie Mac. It is my understanding that in 2010 and 2011 Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored organization, took an investment position betting against wide-spread refinancing for homeowners.  If this is the case, Freddie Mac embraced a position in direct opposition to a policy recommendation that is widely viewed to be essential to our recovery and advocated by your Administration as recently as the State of the Union.'"
