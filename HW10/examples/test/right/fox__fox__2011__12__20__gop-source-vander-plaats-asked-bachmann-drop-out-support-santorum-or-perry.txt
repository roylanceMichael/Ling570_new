Bob Vander Plaats, head of Iowa's influential conservative group "The Family Leader", called Michele Bachmann 's campaign on Saturday to try and persuade the Iowa Straw Poll winner to drop out of the presidential primary race and support either Rick Santorum , or Rick Perry , according to Alice Stewart Communicatons Director for Bachmann. In Iowa Tuesday, Vander Plaats announced that his organization, which holds a lot of pull among religious conservatives, decided to stay neutral during the Iowa Caucuses but he would be personally supporting Santorum for president. 

Stewart says that during Vander Plaats' "weird call" Saturday, Vander Plaats told Bachmann's camp to "join forces with either Santorum or Perry " because the only way religious conservatives could win would be to " unite the Christian candidates". Bachmann's campaign then allegedly replied that they were "absolutely, positively not going to do that" and retorted that they consistently placed better in most polls, than Santorum or Perry. 

Vander Plaats replied via text to FOX, denying the allegations. " Nope", he simply stated when asked if he had called Bachmann to drop out and support another candidate.
