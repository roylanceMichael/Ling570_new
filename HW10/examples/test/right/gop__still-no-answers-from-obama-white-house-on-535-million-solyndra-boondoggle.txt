Still No Answers From Obama White House On $535 Million Solyndra Boondoggle 





Here's Department of Energy official Jonathan Silver not being able to answer a simple question about whether he received any communications from any individuals in the White House, to the point that he has to be reminded that he is under oath: 





Further stonewalling and claims of ignorance came when Rep. Steve Scalise asked Mr. Silver who in the Obama White House made the decision to put taxpayers at the end of the line and on the hook for the $535 million loan to Sylndra. Mr. Silver, not surprisingly, refused to answer the question. Lots of questions that remain to be answered - why are taxpayers guaranteeing a $535 million loan behind private investors, including a prominent Obama donor/bundler? 



And just more proof that the Obama White House really has no clue about what it's doing - Mr. Silver can't say who is in charge of disbursing the $535 million to Solyndra. Rep. Timothy Murphy presses him to stop throwing the rest of his colleagues under the bus and come clean on who is making the decisions. No answer.
