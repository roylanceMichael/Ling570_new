The Romney Campaign circulated what it called an open letter penned by Bob Dole in which the former Senate Majority Leader and GOP Presidential Nominee attacks Newt Gingrich . 

I have not been critical of Newt Gingrich but it is now time to take a stand before it is too late, said Dole. "If Gingrich is the nominee it will have an adverse impact on Republican candidates running for county, state, and federal offices. Hardly anyone who served with Newt in Congress has endorsed him and that fact speaks for itself. He was a one-man-band who rarely took advice. It was his way or the highway. 

The former Senator from Kansas added, In my opinion if we want to avoid an Obama landslide in November, Republicans should nominate Governor Romney as our standard bearer. 

It is worth noting that Dole and Gingrich were not known as the best of friends back when they both were in congress back in the mid 90 s. 

This comes as Gingrich and Romney argue over the former Speaker s assertion that he is a Reagan Conservative and the rightful heir to the Reagan revolution. 

The Gingrich campaign on Thursday pointed reporters to a video from 1995 where Nancy Reagan praises Gingrich, "Ronnie turned that torch over to Newt and the Republican members of Congress to keep that dream alive," said the former first lady. 



The Romney camp and its surrogates have suggested that Gingrich and President Reagan were not as close as the former Speaker would have potential voters believe.
