Weekend Messaging Memo: "Obama Campaign Failures" 



MEMORANDUM 

FROM: Sean Spicer, RNC Communications Director 

TO: Interested Parties 

RE: Weekend Messaging Memo - Obama Campaign Failures 



If you've been following the Republican race lately, you may have missed another story: Barack Obama's struggling campaign.  

The cogs in the Obama campaign apparatus are spinning at full speed, but they just haven't produced the money, message, or momentum of 2008. A failed presidency is producing a failing campaign. 

Money Woes 

In 2008, Barack Obama pledged to uphold the tradition of public financing. Then, when he discovered he could raise millions more without it, he broke his promise, blowing up the campaign finance system in the process. 

2012 brings another installment of Obama's campaign finance hypocrisy. In 2010, he called Super PACs a "threat to democracy." Now, realizing the shortcomings of his own campaign fundraising, he has warmly embraced the Super PAC Priorities USA.  

The trend is appalling: Barack Obama only stands on "principle" when he can afford to. A few million dollars can buy a change of heart. 

And his reelection desperately needed a few million. In four out of the last five months, the RNC outraised the DNC. In the fourth quarter, the RNC outraised the DNC. And the RNC and the Republican candidates outraised the DNC and Barack Obama. December was the first cash-positive month for the DNC since June. 

The poor fundraising isn't for lack of trying. Obama has attended over 80 fundraising events since declaring reelection. In 2011, he held more fundraisers in the year before an election than each of his last five predecessors. 

The support just isn't there for Obama. So he's hoping a little hypocrisy will purchase some. 

Weak Message, Weak Polling 

The poll numbers aren't adding up for the Obama campaign--an indication of their weak message. 

According to Gallup last week, Obama's approval rating is down in 47 states from a year ago. (It's worth noting that Wyoming is one of the three states where his approval went up - from 27.6 percent to 30.6 percent.) The president's approval rating is above 50 percent in only D.C. and 10 reliably blue states. Meanwhile, the majority of Americans continue to believe the country is on the wrong track. 

Obama has also alienated important coalitions that propelled him to victory in 2008. Young voters, dispirited by a weak economy, are unengaged. Hispanic voters, suffering from higher than average unemployment, believe the president has failed; in Florida 60 percent of Hispanics say Obama's campaign promises remain unfulfilled, according to a recent Resurgent Republic poll. And with his latest affront to religious organizations, Obama's Catholic support may wane further. 

This is significant. Obama won many states by a slim margin. If he loses the support of even a sliver of the electorate, he loses these states.  

Low Registration, Zero Momentum 

The Obama campaign has failed to generate momentum for their candidate--a certain source of anxiety in Chicago. 

As a result, the GOP is closing the registration gap. In every battleground state that maintains partisan registration records, the Democrats have a lower share of registered voters than in 2008.   

In Nevada, for example, Republicans have cut the Democrats' advantage from 2008 in half. In New Hampshire, Democrats held an advantage over Republicans in 2008; today, Republicans have the advantage.  

In 2008, Democrats benefitted from a surge in registrations, but there is no such surge in 2012.  

In short, Obama's campaign struggles may not make the headlines, but they are undoubtedly bad news for Democrats as we head toward November. That's something worth remembering - and reporting.
