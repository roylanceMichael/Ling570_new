Conservative South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint said Monday that he may sit out President Obama's long-awaited jobs speech Thursday night to a joint session of Congress. 

"If he sent a written proposal over first, I would go hear him explain it, but frankly right now I'm so frustrated I don't think I'm going to go," DeMint told ABC News' Jonathan Karl, adding, "I can't imagine too many Americans wanting to hear another speech with no real plan attached." 

A senior aide to the senator confirmed the remarks to Fox News made ahead of an afternoon forum in the Palmetto State on Labor Day . DeMint gathered conservatives to hear from a number of the Republican candidates vying in a crowded primary field for chance to take on Obama in 2012. 

The president has been preparing for weeks to lay out a plan to revive the nation's stagnant economy and put Americans back to work. Republicans, during the recent fight over whether or not to raise the nation's debt ceiling, repeatedly denounced the president for not having a detailed plan. 

Few details are known about what President Obama will propose, but it is widely expected that he will offer an extension of the payroll tax cut from the 2009 stimulus bill. It is set to expire at the end of this year. The senior DeMint aide confirmed the senator will likely oppose that move. 

"As the CBO has said, you can't score a speech," DeMint chided to forum goers, referencing the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. "The economy is clearly stalled." 

The senator is the first lawmaker to announce that he will likely boycott the presidential address.
