Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace joined Chris Stirewalt on Wednesday's Power Play Live and told him, ahead of next week's Fox News Republican Presidential primary debate in Ames, the candidates all have a lot riding on Iowa but perhaps no two more than former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN.). 

"All the other candidates are really pushing to be the anti-Mitt Romney candidate, the main alternative to Romney, and I think that especially goes in Iowa for Pawlenty and Bachman," Wallace explained. 

He added, "They both appeal to many of the same voters, social conservatives, tea partiers...and I'll be interested to see how much he goes after her and how she responds to that."
