Is Kaine "Crazy" To Skip Obama's Visit? 



It appears that candidate Tim Kaine is having a difficult time heeding the advice of former DNC Chairman Tim Kaine.  As Party Chairman, Kaine famously said that Democrat candidates were  "Crazy"  to push back on their leaders and that the President is helpful on the campaign trail nationwide.  But when Obama comes to meet voters in Kaine's home state, the President's close friend and ally is nowhere to be seen...

When President Obama crosses the Potomac into Virginia Tuesday morning to talk about reining in the nation's escalating debt, which Democrats will be standing with him? 

Not Tim Kaine. 

Word is the former governor, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee chairman and friend of the president will be campaigning for U.S. Senate -- but in another part of the state. 

The state's current U.S. senators aren't around either. 

Sen. Mark "Mr. Gang of Six himself" Warner has a packed schedule in Hampton Roads. Sen. Jim Webb is on a two-week trip to Korea, Vietnam, Japan and Guam. 

Rep. Jim Moran's office tells us he has a prior commitment. We never heard back from Rep. Bobby Scott, who is mulling a run against Kaine for senate in 2012. 

Even Brian Moran, chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, won't be there. He is sending his wife, Karyn, in his place. 

But Rep. Gerry Connolly will be standing by his president. Obama will, after all, be in Connolly's district when he heads to the Northern Virginia Community College in Annandale. 

Who else will be there? We tried to find out, but with no success. The state party told us to check in with Organizing for America -- which referred us to the DNC, which did not know. Guess we'll find out later this morning.
