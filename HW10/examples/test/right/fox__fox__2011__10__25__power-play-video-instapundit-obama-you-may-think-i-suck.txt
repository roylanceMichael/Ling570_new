Chris Stirewalt and Glenn Reynolds, also known as the "InstaPundit" discussed President Obama's pitch to members of his liberal base in Hollywood . 

Reynolds says it's a bit like Obama is telling them, "You may think I suck but it's worth voting for me and keeping the Republicans out." 

President Obama told supporters at a Los Angeles fundraiser on Monday night that the 2012 election will not be "sexy... but we need to grind it out." 

"It's going from hope-ium to hold your nose-ium and vote," Reynolds told Stirewalt. "When you come down off a drug like hope-ium you kind of have a hangover, and I think some people are going to be too hungover to make it to the polls."
