Tuesday is a tale of two budgets. 

House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., along with the heads of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, meet with President Obama at the White House at 10:15 a.m. ET to try to hammer out an agreement to fund the government through the rest of the fiscal year. The current measure expires at midnight Friday. 

If that effort stalls out, House Republicans have a plan b: a one week bill that cuts $12 billion from current spending rates and funds the Department of Defense for the year. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and others at the Pentagon have complained about the current week-to-week approach. 

If that wasn't enough number crunching for you, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., plans to unveil his spreadsheet for 2012. The plan is said to cut $6 trillion from the federal budget over ten years, modify sections of the tax code, and overhaul the Medicare and Medicaid health care entitlement programs. 

House Democrats have not been fans of Ryan's previous plans. Budget Committee Ranking Member Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., will discuss Ryan's newest proposal at a 1:00 p.m. ET news conference. 

The Justice Department's decision to try alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other suspects via military tribunals is the focus of a House Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for 10:00 a.m. ET. Legal scholars and David Beamer, whose son Todd perished on United flight 93, testify. 

Congress plans to put the finishing touches on a bill to repeal part of the massive health care overhaul passed last year. The Senate will hold a vote near midday to eliminate a tax filing provision in the bill that many lawmakers, including President Obama, was unduly burdensome on small businesses.
