Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin has not decided to flex her political muscle and endorse a Republican candidate for President yet; but she has picked a favorite quarterback, Tim Tebow . 

Sunday on "America's News Headquarters" Governor Palin said she is impressed with Tebow's fearless bold display of his faith. "He knows that Jesus is going to rock your world when you give it over to him and he is bold about it," Palin explains. 

Tim Tebow has attracted unprecedented attention on and off the football field for his unorthodox skill-set and his frequent expressions of his faith on the field. In fact, it's such a phenomenon that a new word has been created to describe his expression of faith: "Tebowing." 

The Urban Dictionary defines "Tebowing" as a gesture "to get down on a knee and start praying, even if everyone else around you is doing something completely different." 

As far as Governor Palin is concerned, Tebow is a model for us all, "(he) knows that the son of GOD should be honored and praised and Tebow does that and I respect it." Lucky for the current GOP presidential field, Tebow can't run for the Presidency foranother 11 years. The Governor does not express the same level of excitement for the current political field of GOP presidential candidates. 

Governor Palin is not ready to endorse anyone yet, explaining that "My endorsement is going to be with sincerity and enthusiasm and I'm just not there yet. And, you know, there is no need to endorse until that enthusiasm really is within me, in my gut." 

Governor Palin believes former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Governor Mitt Romney will be the two frontrunners after Iowa. But, Palin cautioned not to count the "traditional conservatives" out, saying, "Bachmann and Santorum, of course, they are known by many as 'the conservatives,' and they will do better I think than some pundits predict." 

Palin had kind words for Congressman Ron Paul , "guaranteeing" he will definitely do well because "he has the loyal hard working base of independent patriots who know that he has fought on with his acknowledgement of domestic spending crisis that we face that has got to be addressed or we are going under." 

Palin isn't ruling Texas Gov. Rick Perry out, saying he has the money to potentially have a good showing in Iowa.
