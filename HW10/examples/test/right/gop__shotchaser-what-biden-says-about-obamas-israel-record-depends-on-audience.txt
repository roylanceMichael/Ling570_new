SHOT/CHASER: What Biden Says About Obama's Israel Record Depends On Audience 



SHOT: In His Speech At NYU Today, Biden Claimed Romney Was Wrong To Say That U.S.-Israeli Relations Had "Hit A Low" 

Biden Criticized Romney For Saying "Relations Between The United States And Israel Had 'Hit A Low.'"  BIDEN: "Israel leaders have called President Obama's support for and cooperation with Israel, 'unprecedented.' Governor Romney, though, said relations between the United States and Israel had, quote, hit a low, end of quote. And went on to accuse President Obama of, quote -this is a good one - throwing Israel under the bus, end of quote. That's just one of a long litany of untruths of our administration's policy toward Israel uttered by Governor Romney." (Vice President Joseph Biden, Remarks On National Security, New York , NY, 4/26/12) 

CHASER: In 2011, Biden Said That Obama Had Mishandled The U.S.-Israeli Relationship 

Biden, While Speaking With Rabbis In Boca Raton, FL, Listed Off The Repeated Insults By The Obama Administration Against Israel.  "Mr. Biden told the rabbis that the administration had made a few missteps in its handling of the Israel relationship, including Mr. Obama's decision not to go to Jerusalem as president, after he made his famous Cairo speech in 2009 in which he elevated the plight of the Palestinians to equal status with the Israelis'. (In fact, it was Mr. Biden who traveled to Israel that year, in what ended up being a disastrous trip in which the Israeli government announced new settlements just before his meeting with Mr. Netanyahu, prompting a sharp response from the Obama administration that included an irate 45-minute telephone call from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to Mr. Netanyahu.)"
