Texas Gov. Rick Perry may have ended his run for president, but it looks like his campaign days are not over. 

Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan says his boss is open to several activities: campaigning for Newt Gingrich , the man he has endorsed in the 2012 primary; running for re-election as Texas governor in 2014; and launching another bid for president again in 2016 if President Obama is re-elected. 

Perry will spend the weekend in Austin. He has no firm plans to campaign for Gingrich, but Sullivan says it is possible he will hit the road after the South Carolina primary. 

When thanking Perry for his support on Thursday, Gingrich mentioned Perry s role in a "10th Amendment Enforcement Project." 

Gingrich floated that idea Thursday morning when Perry called him to share the news he was dropping out and endorsing Gingrich. 

"The speaker suggested the idea of putting together an effort to highlight and restore the 10th Amendment. He asked Perry to help. Perry agreed," Sullivan said. 

"It is a priority and passion for the governor and has been for years. Much of the governor's book 'Fed Up' surrounded the overreaching and moving power of the federal government and the need to return that power to the states and localities," Sullivan added. 

Sullivan says Gingrich and Perry have been good friends for years. They have had several policy and philosophical discussions on issues over the years, including ones about the need to return more power to the states. One of those talks led to Gingrich writing the forward to Perry's book. 

Sullivan says the details of this 10th Amendment project are "TBD." 

What is certain is that the self-proclaimed "Washington Outsider" will continue speaking out on the subject. Sullivan said he expects the three-term governor to work to organize other governors, local officials and state legislators to champion the 10th Amendment and continue what they started in this campaign -- convincing Congress and Washington to return more power and authority to state and localities.
