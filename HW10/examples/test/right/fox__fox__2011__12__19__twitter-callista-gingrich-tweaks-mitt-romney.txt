Unlike some of the other presidential candidates' spouses , Callista Gingrich has not played a very public role in her husband's campaign but recently on her Twitter feed , she re-tweeted two hits at Mitt Romney written by a Gingrich supporter with the Twitter handle @UnitedStates. 

"Mitt's 'Money Never Sleeps' photo. I personally don't mind it, but it won't play well in Ohio'' reads one re-tweet concerning Romney's f amous Bain Capital photo from the 1980's. 

And the other one, a reference to yesterday's "FOX News Sunday" interview with Romney. 

"Poor Romney. He just is a sound bite candidate. Chris Wallace pulled the string from his back, and he spewed consultant apprvd policy #tcot ", it says. 

Gingrich and his campaign have mostly avoided going negative, focusing on what the former Speaker of the House calls "positive ideas and positive solutions."
