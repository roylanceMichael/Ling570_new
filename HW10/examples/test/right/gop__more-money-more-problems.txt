"The Obama administration has poured roughly $5 billion in taxpayer funds into the electric-car industry, offering incentives to manufacturers, their suppliers and even car buyers who might want to go green. But analysts say the risk is rising that taxpayers in many cases will not see a return on their money soon, if ever. Instead, they warn that some federally subsidized companies could be forced to shut down in coming months." (Carol D.

OBAMA: "A solar panel company a solar power company called Amonix received a roughly $6 million tax credit for a new facility they're building in the Las Vegas area -- a tax credit they were able to match with roughly $12 million in private capital.  That s happening right now.  And that's just one of over, that s just one of over 180 projects that received manufacturing tax credits in over 40 states. Now, here's the the only problem we have is these credits were working so well, there aren't enough tax credits to go around. Now, here's the the only problem we have is these credits were working so well, there aren't enough tax credits to go around.  There are more worthy projects than there are tax credits.  When we announced the program last year, it was such a success we received 500 applications requesting over $8 billion in tax credits, but we only had $2.3 billion to invest.  In other words, we had almost four times as many worthy requests as we had tax credits." (President Barack Obama,  Remarks At University Of Las Vegas , Las Vegas, NV, 7/9/10)
