It's official. President Obama's State of the Union address will take place on January 25 this year. The formal invitation was sent Tuesday, according to protocol, by House Speaker John Boehner. Fox has learned that Mr. Obama has accepted it. 

The president will speak at a key time for his party and for the nation. With millions still out of work, Americans are looking to their government for solutions. After losing control of the House, the president is perhaps recalibrating his message from years past. Adding unexpected poignancy to his remarks is the deadly Tucson shooting this past Saturday, which left a member of Congress in critical condition and has spurred dialogue on everything from political rhetoric to the safety of public officials. 

Stay tuned to Fox News Channel for all of the latest on Mr. Obama's speech.
