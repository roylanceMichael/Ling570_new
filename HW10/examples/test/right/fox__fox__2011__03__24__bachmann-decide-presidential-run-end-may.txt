Republican Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann indicated to top aides Thursday that she will decide whether to test the waters for a presidential run by the end of May. 

Should she decide to press forward, she will file papers with the Federal Election Commission and form an Exploratory Committee around the first week of June.
