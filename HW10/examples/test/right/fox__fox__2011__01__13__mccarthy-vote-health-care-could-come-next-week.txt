As the House of Representatives grapples with when to get back to business in the wake of Saturday's shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., in Tucson, FOX News has learned when one high-profile piece of legislation will be brought to the floor. 

A spokesman for Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., says work will resume on a health care repeal bill when the House comes back into session next week. 

"As the White House noted, it is important for Congress to get back to work, and to that end we will resume thoughtful consideration of the health care bill next week," Cantor spokesman Brad Dayspring said in an email to FOX News. 

"Americans have legitimate concerns about the cost of the new health care law and its effect on the ability to grow jobs in our country. It is our expectation that the debate will continue to focus on those substantive policy differences surrounding the new law." 

Earlier Thursday, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Republicans could bring a vote to repeal health care to the floor when lawmakers come back to Washington Tuesday. 

"I would think we would do health care next week," McCarthy told FOX News. "Back on the schedule." 

McCarthy added that he thinks it's appropriate for the House to return to normal business next week.
