It's just a form email, but some days even a form email can show how "old habits die hard" even at the White House . 

Around noon on Wednesday, the White House press office sent out an updated schedule - indicating a time change for the White House briefing. The only problem? It said the updated time for the press briefing with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had been moved. Now, as we all know, Gibbs left the White House a few weeks ago to start his own business and Jay Carney has taken over at the podium. 

The White House quickly issued a correction - less than five minutes went by - that made clear it was not a "Back to the Future" moment and that Carney would be briefing at 1p.m.
