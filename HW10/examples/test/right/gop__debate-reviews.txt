Debate reviews 



Reviews are in - very important night for Mitt Romney who was energetic and aggressive against the president who was visibly irritated, on defense and explaining all night. 



@ChuckTodd:  Very important night for Mitt Romney. And he rose to the challenge.  

@VanityFair:  Has Obama ever been this off his game? 

@davidgregory: Romney's in command right now. Taking on the President directly added a spark." #DenverDebate  

@davidgregory: One hour in Romney is far more energetic and aggressive than the President." #DenverDebate 

@SuzyKhimm:  Obama is stumbling, hesitant in describing the selling points of his signature achievement. Not good.  

@DavidCornDC  RT  @SuzyKhimm:  Obama is stumbling, hesitant in describing the selling points of his signature achievement. Not good.  

@ TheFix:  Good golly. Obama looks very annoyed/unhappy. #debates  

@JoshMcElveen  We have never seen @BarackObama on the defensive like this. Unprecedented. Wrong or right. @MittRomney is on the game he needed to be on. 

@LukeRussert:  Obama shooting himself by not getting personal on HCR. Clinton probably screaming at TV. He needs an I feel your pain moment. 

@FixAaron:  Slowly the left is starting to acknowledge that Obama is losing this debate.  #debates 

Weekly Standard:  Best Debate Performance By a GOP Presidential Candidate in More than Two Decades 

@chuckplunkett  Romney is far more on his game tonight. #debate #copolitics #denverdebate 

@GregGutfeld:  Obama is rolling down a mountain like Homer Simpson hitting every rock along the way.  

@ChrisStigall : This debate is devastating Obama. Simply no spinning. The stammering, the blinking, looking away. Obama s outmatched.  #1210StigallDebate 

@JohnJHarwood : Romney looks a lot happier than Obama on that stage #CNBC2012   

@sullydish  This is a rolling calamity for Obama. He s boring, abstract, and less human-seeming than Romney!  

@stephenfhayes:  Is there anyone who doesn t work for the Obama campaign or the DNC who thinks Barack Obama is winning this debate? 

@EliStokols  Romney really is ahead on style and substance. Just wonder if anyone is still watching all this wonky policy stuff.  #debates 

@JimHeath10TV  As I tweeted before the debate Obama s #1 goal: Don t look aggravated or irritated. Like many incumbents before, he has failed that goal.  

@Cam_Joseph:  When you re explaining, you re losing. Obama s been explaining all night.  

@kirstenpowers10:  I ll be interested to see how media spins this debate as an Obama win. 

@DaveWedge:  Obama looks like Rex Ryan against Belichick. Perplexed. #prezdebate #whoyagot  

@billmaher:  i can t believe i m saying this, but Obama looks like he DOES need a teleprompter  

@APBobLewis:  President appears flat-footed, unprepared, perhaps a bit distracted. No haymaker either side, but Romney s more aggressive, focused. 

@tomfitzgerald  Romney is puncturing the presidential bubble 

@LarrySabato   Obama now has spoken 38 mins to Romney s 33 mins but Romney has gotten more from less. 

@JoeStGeorge:   Mr President, your entitled to your plane and your own house but not your own facts thats a great line by Romney. 

@billmaher:  Obama s not looking like he came for a job interview, Romney so far does 

@Jheil:  Obama tells Lehrer he s done a great job. #liarliar 

@DraperRobert:  OK 5 min to go but prediction: Romney has closed the gap in 90 minutes 

@HotlineReid:  Obama: I think this has been a terrific debate. MOSTLY FALSE!  

@ErinBurnett:  Undecided dial test raw #s show: #Romney won the big moments 7 comments scored over 70. #obama had 4.
