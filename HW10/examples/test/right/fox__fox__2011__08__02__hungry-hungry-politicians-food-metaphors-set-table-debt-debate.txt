Washington politicians must have big appetites because throughout the debt debate they kept using food metaphors to emphasize their points. 

The winning entry belonged to Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., who called the debt compromise a "sugar-coated Satan sandwich." House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. expanded on this sentiment, adding it came "with Satan fries on the side." 

President Obama started the food war of the words when he announced his opposition to a short-term debt ceiling extension. "Pull off the Band-Aid, eat our peas," he said. "Now is the time to do it. If not now, when?" 

The president later urged Congress to "start talking turkey" after the Gang of Six unveiled its latest debt reduction plan, but that plan was never fully cooked and failed to gain traction. 

House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio, entered the fray and used a popular dessert to explain his frustration with President Obama and The White House . 

"Dealing with them the last couple months has been like dealing with Jell-O," Boehner said. "Some days it's firmer than others. Sometimes it's like they've left it out overnight." 

The Republican National Committee jumped on the "Jell-O" bandwagon and called Obama, "His Jello-Ness, The President." 

Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla, made President Obama a wager on the Cut, Cap, and Balance legislation that involved some prime beef. Coburn said, "I will bet you a Porterhouse steak if it lands on his desk, he will sign this." 

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney accepted the bet and added, "I would refrain from heading to the Safeway to buy A1 [steak sauce], because the president has very clearly vowed to veto a bill if such a bill were to arrive on his desk." 

No winner was declared because the bill failed to make it out of the kitchen and to the president's desk. 

Rep. Reid Ribble, R-Wisc., might as well have suggested the U.S. economy sign up for Weight Watchers when on the House floor he said, "Our bloated and obese federal budget needs a healthy and balanced diet, one that trims the fat of overspending and grows the muscle of our nation's economy." 

Then when it became time for Congress to finally vote on the debt compromise it was all about "whipping the vote." This has nothing to do with mashed potatoes, but refers to the party "whip," whose job it is to ensure members vote with their party. 

And if that isn't enough, making laws is commonly referred to as "making sausage," because if people really knew how laws were actually made, they'd be disgusted with the process. 

Hungry yet?
