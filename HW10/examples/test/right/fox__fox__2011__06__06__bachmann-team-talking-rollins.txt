Senior Bachmann aides tell FOX News that political strategist Ed Rollins is providing advice to the Minnesota Republican but has not actually been hired as of yet. 

Those aides remind us that since Bachmann has not actually formed a presidential exploratory committee yet, there really is no way for Rollins to be hired as a campaign operative yet, or for him to "sign on." 

Rollins is one of the biggest names in the GOP presidential campaign game, famous for employing a tough brand of politics. Most recently Rollins was the national campaign director for Mike Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign, but is most remembered for running the 1984 Reagan-Bush re-election run. 

Bachmann aides tell FOX News they have also talked with longtime GOP presidential campaign hand Charlie Black about a filling a senior role in the potential campaign. 

Bachmann is expected to announce the formation of a presidential exploratory committee by the end of June. Last week her congressional chief of staff left his post and said he would be in a new position soon. Bachmann has said she would make a big announcement her birthplace of Waterloo, Iowa by the end of June.
