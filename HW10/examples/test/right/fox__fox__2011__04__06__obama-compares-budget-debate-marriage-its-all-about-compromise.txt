At a green energy themed event in Pennsylvania Wednesday, President Obama, in speaking about the budget battle back in Washington, evoked a reference to which many Americans can relate. 

Marriage. 

More specifically, Mr. Obama, married himself over 18 years, drew a parallel between the parties on Capitol Hill working together to strike a deal on a budget - thus avoiding a government shutdown the end of the week - and dealing with conflict in marriage. 

"You want everybody to act like adults, quit playing games, realize that it's not just 'my way or the highway,'" the president said at the town-hall style event before workers at a wind turbine company. 

"How many folks are married here?" Obama asked. Dozens of hands were raised. "When was the last time you just got your way?" the president added, with a knowing smile. 

"That's not how it works, right?" Obama stated to the head nodding, chuckling audience. 

"The fact is, is that you have to make compromises as a family. That's what we are, the American family," the president asserted. 

"So Democrats and Republicans need to get together, work through their differences, keep the government running so we can focus on keeping this economy growing, focus on things like clean energy, driving down gas prices. That's our job. That's what people want to see -- results," Obama said. 

While there was speculation Wednesday morning that the president would host House and Senate leaders for another budget meeting as he did Tuesday, no such gathering was called. A White House aide told Fox News, that was because there were "signs of progress" in the budget talks, a sign many took to mean the White House was trying to give Hill leaders some space to hammer out a deal. 

But aboard Air Force One Wednesday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney announced the president was getting involved. 

"He has now decided that not enough progress has been made and therefore he has invited the Speaker of the House and the Senate Majority Leader to the White House at 8:45pm this evening," Carney told reporters. 

So the president will take on the role of marriage counselor, at least for this evening, as Congress struggles over budgetary compromises.
