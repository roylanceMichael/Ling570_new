Let the games begin! 

First Lady Michelle Obama will lead the U.S. delegation to the Olympics this summer in London, the White House announced Friday. Mrs. Obama will be accompanied by American Olympic greats including swimmer Summer Sanders, gymnast Dominique Dawes, and soccer player Brandi Chastain along with Paralympic medalists and the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom , Louis Susman. 

"Olympians and Paralympians are true American heroes and role models for all of us, especially our young people," the First Lady said in a statement. 

Mrs. Obama's London itinerary includes the Opening ceremony and meetings with U.S. athletes, but the fitness-conscious first lady will also focus on her "Let's Move!" campaign focusing on childhood obesity and fitness. "I know that this delegation will help inspire a generation of young people to get into the Olympic spirit by getting active and healthy so they can reach their fullest potential and reach their dreams," Obama said. 

The 2012 summer games begin July 27th and run through August 12th. With the heat of the summer campaign in full swing before the conventions, President Obama is not likely to make an appearance in London. 

Governor Romney may be sending a delegation of his own to the Olympic games, since an extended family member has qualified. Ann Romney's horse Rafalca is expected to compete in dressage. In a recent interview to WJR Radio, Mrs. Romney called it, "a dream come true."
