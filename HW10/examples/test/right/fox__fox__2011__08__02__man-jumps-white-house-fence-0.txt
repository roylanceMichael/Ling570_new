Unites States Secret Service apprehended a man Tuesday night after he jumped over the fence on the White House north lawn. He was identified as James Dirk Crudup, a 41-year-old homeless man. Crudup was taken to the 1st District precinct in Washington D.C. and charged with unlawful entry and attempted contempt for violating a stay away order at the White House . 

The security breach occurred just before 8 PM eastern. "He was immediately taken into custody by uniform division officers and he had a back pack that is being examined by EOD personnel," Secret Service Spokesperson Edwin Donovan told Fox News. 

It is not believed the president's safety was ever in jeopardy. 

This incident occurred just days after a six year old girl squeezed through the White House fence on Sunday.
