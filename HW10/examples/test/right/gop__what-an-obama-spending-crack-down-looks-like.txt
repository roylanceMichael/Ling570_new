What an Obama Spending Crack Down Looks Like 



The White House today announced they are "cracking down" on conference spending - capping all conferences at the low, low price of $500,000 (unless they are granted "special permission"). Please consider the following response from the RNC: 



"At $500,000 per conference, "Debt King" Obama is setting such a strict spending limit that next year's GSA conference will be forced to decide: mindreader or magician, not both. With wasteful policies like this it's not hard to figure out why Obama has run the three largest deficits in history." - RNC Spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski
