'Tis the season to spread merriment and Newt Gingrich and his wife Callista are doing that on TV in Iowa. 

Friday, Gingrich will begin airing a Christmas ad that includes a holiday message. The ad will replace all other campaign ads airing in Iowa. The message of thanks and prayer is another attempt to keep with Gingrich's positive campaign pledge.

Tuesday morning on Dan Kennedy's radio show on WOC in Davenport, Iowa Gingrich called in to talk about his campaign strategy. He said, "We are releasing today a Merry Christmas ad, in which Callista and I wish everybody around Iowa a Merry Christmas and about the importance of our faith and the importance of celebrating Christmas." 

Gingrich continued by saying Iowans have a choice, "You want some guy who runs vicious negative ads Christmas week you've got some candidates. You want somebody who is actually positive and wants you to have a Merry Christmas you've got Newt Gingrich ." 

Gingrich called negative ads other campaigns are airing in Iowa "absurd," adding that, "a lot of these ads are just plan not true." 

Gingrich has asked folks he has met on the campaign trail to ask candidates to take down negative ads off the air. "If these guys were running a business they'd all be put out of business for running false advertisement," said Gingrich. 

"I don't mind if they run contrast ads in positions," Gingrich clarified, but he insists he won't go there again. 

"I've made the pledge that I'm going to stay positive." 

While his main GOP rivals are stumping in Iowa, Gingrich is planning to spend the next two days in Virginia, working to gather enough signatures to be on the Virginia presidential primary ballot. The filing deadline for the Virginia Presidential primary ballot is Thursday December 22nd. Newt and Callista will also spend the Christmas holiday in Virginia, where Mrs. Gingrich will sing in her church choir over the holiday weekend.
