Former White House Press Secretary James Brady, shot thirty years ago today, visited the White House briefing room Wednesday that is now named after him. Brady was shot in the head during the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981. 



He became permanently disabled after the incident and has spent the last thirty years fighting in support of gun control . 

Brady was wearing a bracelet in support of Rep. Gabby Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman shot earlier this year at a town hall event while visiting constituents at home. He told reporters, "there were so many similarities to mine that it hurt a lot." 

The former press secretary met with President Obama and said he was glad to see him. Brady and his wife Sarah spent the day meeting with conservative and liberal members of Congress on the Hill, including Representative Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was killed in a 1993 Long Island Rail Road shooting, and Representative Michele Bachmann , R-Minn, who made controversial remarks about arming constituents during energy reform in 2009. 

Brady told reporters at the White House "you can never push too hard," for gun control .
