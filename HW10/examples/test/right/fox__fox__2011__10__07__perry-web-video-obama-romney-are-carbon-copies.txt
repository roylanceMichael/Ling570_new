In an attempt to bring the environmental debate back to jobs, GOP candidate Rick Perry 's campaign has just released a web video claiming Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama are "carbon copies" when it comes to their pro-environmental policies. 

The ad focuses on Romney's support of carbon emission caps while he was governor of Massachusetts. 

The Perry campaign claims Romney "provided the blueprint" for both Obama's health care plan and its environmental policies. It points to two former Romney environmental advisors, Gina McCarthy and John Holdren , who now work for the Obama administration. 

The Texas governor has taken some heat for repeatedly saying he questions the science behind climate change. Perry is a big defender of his state's oil and coal industries and has even sued the EPA over its greenhouse gas emission regulations.
