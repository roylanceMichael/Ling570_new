Mega-star investor Warren Buffett will be hosting a fundraiser for President Obama on September 30 in New York City, a Democratic official confirms to Fox News. 

The details are still being worked out, but the event, as first reported by the New York Post, is slated to be an "economic forum," with a Q A hosted by former White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee , the paper is reporting. 

Goolsbee's last day in the Obama administration was a few weeks ago. 

The fundraiser is scheduled to take place at the Four Seasons restaurant, with tickets costing $10,000 a person, and VIP spots topping $35,800, the Post detailed. 

Reportedly the invite reads, "As all guests are seated for dinner, Buffett will go around to all tables and shake hands, then he and Austan will sit for the program and discussion." What will be discussed is Buffett's recent highly publicized claim that the wealthy should pay higher taxes. 

Buffett, also dubbed "The Oracle of Omaha," recently wrote a New York Times op-ed saying that the rich should pay more in taxes, a position the president supports. Obama referenced the op-ed last week on his Midwest bus tour. 

Obama and Buffett have had a friendly relationship over the years. The investor backed Obama in 2008 and the two have met and talked recently. 

They spoke Monday while the president was on vacation in Martha's Vineyard. 

"The president and Mr. Buffett discussed the overall outlook on the economy and the reaction to the headwinds we've experienced over the last couple of months. They talked a little bit about some possible measures that would spur investment and increase economic growth. And they also talked about some measures that could address the long-term fiscal situation in this country," Principal Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Monday. 

Obama is working on a major jobs speech and plan which he is set to unveil right after Labor Day . 

Buffett also made economic news and stocks opened higher Friday after his investment arm, Berkshire Hathaway, announced a $5 billlion stake in Bank of America. He also made similar investments to GE and Goldman Sachs during the financial crash a couple years ago. 

Obama's re-election fundraising stalled this summer with the debt deal negotiations interrupting much of his schedule, however it is expected to pick up again this fall. 

Buffett's last known public stop at the White House was in July. He was also awarded the presidential medal of freedom in February.
