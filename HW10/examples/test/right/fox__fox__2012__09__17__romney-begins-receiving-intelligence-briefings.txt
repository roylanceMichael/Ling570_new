Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney received his first intelligence briefing from the Obama administration on Monday at FBI headquarters in Los Angeles. 

Romney press secretary Rick Gorka confirmed that the GOP candidate "met with members from the intelligence community." The briefing lasted two hours. 

The classified briefings are customary for major-party candidates after accepting the nomination at their party convention. They come after the candidate undergoes a security clearance process. 

Romney's meeting with intelligence officials comes on the heels of the latest upheaval in the Middle East . 

The attacks in Libya and subsequent uprisings in neighboring nations put the candidates' positions on foreign policy in the forefront of the campaign. 

While Romney devoted much of his time last week criticizing what he perceived as the president's failures in dealings overseas, he largely reverted back to messaging on domestic issues Monday while addressing the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
