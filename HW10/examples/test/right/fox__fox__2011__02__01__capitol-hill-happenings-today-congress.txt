Health care takes center stage yet again on Capitol Hill . 

Senate Republicans, emboldened by Monday's federal court ruling against the new health care law, plan to step up their efforts to overturn the overhaul. Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C, and John Barrasso, R-Wyo., introduce legislation at a 12:00 p.m. ET news conference to allow states to "opt-out" of three of the major provisions of Obamacare: the individual mandate, employer mandate, and the expansion of Medicaid. Graham and Barrasso believe enough states would opt out to effectively kill the bill. 

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., plans to renew a push to hold a vote on the House-passed health care repeal bill, and a Senate bill to repeal the law has the support of all 47 Republican senators, according to its author Jim DeMint, R-S.C. 

We expect McConnell to talk about his plans to try to bring up a repeal vote, as well as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's, D-Nev., thoughts on bringing up such a bill at their post policy luncheon media availabilities in the early afternoon.
