The weather is projected to be a balmy 80 degrees in Boston Thursday, and the Obama campaign aims to further raise the barometer for Mitt Romney by sending senior strategist David Axelrod to the presumptive Republican nominee's home turf. 

Axelrod's trip to Boston, home to Romney's campaign headquarters, is an effort to push the notion that the former Massachusetts governor is purposefully trying to avoid talking about his record in public office, and comes one day after Axelrod issued a five-page campaign memo casting Romney as a poor steward of the state economy during his tenure as governor. 

President Obama has justified his attacks on Romney's track record at Bain Capital by arguing his opponent has been steering the national dialogue towards his business experience rather than his time as governor. 

"Governor Romney, his main calling card for why he thinks he should be President is his business expertise," the president said in Chicago on May 21. "He is not going out there touting his experience in Massachusetts. He is saying, I'm a business guy and I know how to fix it, and this is his business." 

In a sit-down interview with Fox News' Bill Hemmer , Romney said there will be plenty of time in the months leading up to the November election for voters to get to know him. 

"We're just beginning a general election," he said, with his wife Ann sitting by his side. "We've gone through a primary, not a lot of people have focused time on the characteristics of a new candidate like myself. And people will get to know me better. I'm - my guess is they're going to get to know more about me than they'd like to by the time we're finished." 

Part two of Hemmer's interview with the Romneys airs Thursday at 9 a.m. on Fox News.
