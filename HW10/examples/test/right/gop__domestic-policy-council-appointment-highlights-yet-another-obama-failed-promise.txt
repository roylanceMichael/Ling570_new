Obama Promised Lobbyists Would Not Find A Job In His White House 

PROMISE: Obama Promised That Lobbyists Would Not "Find A Job In [His] White House."  "President Obama promised during his campaign that lobbyists 'won t find a job in my White House.' ... Formalized in a recent presidential executive order, it forbids executive branch employees from working in an agency, or on a program, for which they have lobbied in the last two years." (Kenneth P. Vogel Mike Allen, "Obama Finds Room For Lobbyists,"  Politico , 1/30/09)  Obama:   "[Lobbyists] Won t Find A Job In My White House."  OBAMA: "One year from now, we have the chance to tell all those corporate lobbyists that the days of them setting the agenda in Washington are over. I have done more to take on lobbyists than any other candidate in this race and I ve won. I don t take a dime of their money, and when I am President, they won t find a job in my White House." (Sen. Barack Obama,  Remarks At A Campaign Event , Spartanburg, SC, 11/3/07) 

BROKEN: President Obama Has Granted Numerous Exceptions To His Lobbyist Ban.  "Yet in the past few days, a number of exceptions have been granted, with the administration conceding at least two waivers and that a handful of other appointees will recuse themselves from dealing with matters on which they lobbied within the two-year window."
