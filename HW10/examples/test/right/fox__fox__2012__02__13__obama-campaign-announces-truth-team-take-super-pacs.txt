The Obama reelection campaign on Monday announced a new "Truth Team," whose goal is to drum up support from online supporters and grassroots activists to help promote President Obama and challenge Republicans attacks. 

This is the second move that the campaign has taken in recent weeks to try to balance influence of the so-called super PACS. Last week, Obama reversed a prior decision and told supporters to back an Obama-aligned super PAC run by former White House staffers. Previously, the president had decried the influence of the PACs. 

Obama For America announced the move, which includes four new separate websites: BarackObama.com/TruthTeam, KeepingHisWord.com, KeepingGOPHonest.com and AttackWatch.com. 

The reelection team is calling it a "new national effort by President Obama supporters online and on the ground to promote the president s achievements, respond to attacks on his record and hold the eventual Republican nominee accountable." 

The sites will include fact checks, online tools for social networking and videos and resources for activists. 

The Truth Teams also happens to be launching in key battleground states like Ohio, Florida, Colorado, Arizona and Virginia. A release from the campaign notes that unions, a core, energized and organized Democratic constituency, will take part. 

The e-mail to supporters announcing the new project highlights Mitt Romney but the effort is aimed to lay the groundwork ahead of whoever becomes the eventual Republican nominee. 

In 2008, the Obama election team launched a "Fight the Smears project, which the reelect camp says had more than 1 million participants. The goal is to have 2 million people take part in the Truth Team.
