The government's fiscal year ends September 30 and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer , D-Md., believes the president and some members of Congress will be at loggerheads like they were in April, potentially bringing the federal government to the brink of another shutdown. 

In April, Congress waited until the last minute to pass a budget for the rest of the 2011 fiscal year, finally coming to an agreement late on a Friday night and narrowly averting a government shutdown the next day. 

"I think we're going to be back at this dispute September 30th," Hoyer said. "They (House Republicans) have passed appropriations bills that will not pass the Senate." 

Now Congress is locked in another last-minute standoff over how to cut the nation's debt and raise the debt ceiling.
