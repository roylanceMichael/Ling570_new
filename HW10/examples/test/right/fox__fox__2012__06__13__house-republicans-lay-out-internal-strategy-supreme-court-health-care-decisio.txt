The House Republican leadership has started to instruct its members and Congressional staff about how to respond to the Supreme Court's three possible rulings on the health care law, according to an internal memo obtained by Fox. 

The document begins, "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail." 

It outlines suggestions for how to counter the Supreme Court declares the law constitutional, partially repeals it or fully repeals it. The decision is expected for release later this month. 

The memo is titled "Preparing for the President's Health Care Law Decision." It advises Republican House offices to schedule town halls on the issue during the July 4 recess when lawmakers are back in their districts. It also recommends that members meet with health care providers or businesses affected by the law (or its repeal). The meetings would come, at the least, a week following the court's ruling. 

The missive also suggests that lawmakers take time to read the court's ruling in full immediately upon its release. "Many of your constituents and the press will ask if you read the entire opinion," the memo reads. It also recommends that press secretaries prepare statements for each scenario ahead of the last week of June. 

The GOP leadership cautions offices to prepare for a deluge of messages and phone calls from constituents immediately following the court's ruling. It also warns that they should be ready for protesters that may become disruptive.
