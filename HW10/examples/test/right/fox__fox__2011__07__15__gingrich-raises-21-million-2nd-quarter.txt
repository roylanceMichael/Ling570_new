The presidential campaign of Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich raised $2.1 million in the second quarter of 2011. 

The numbers filed with the Federal Election Committee Friday show the Gingrich campaign has about $322,000 in cash on hand and is also carrying just over one million dollars in debt. 

"The majority of our donors are small dollar donors, a demonstration of the health of our campaign," said campaign spokesman R.C. Hammond. "We're very confident we're going to have the resources we need to run the type of campaign we want to run." 

Gingrich's fundraising number will be seen as underwhelming by plenty of political observers. It took Gingrich about three months to bring in roughly the same amount of money Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann raised in less than three weeks. 

On background sources within the Gingrich campaign acknowledged to FOX News that fundraising tailed off during some of Gingrich's rough patches, "But the clouds are parting now and we feel we've weathered the storm."
