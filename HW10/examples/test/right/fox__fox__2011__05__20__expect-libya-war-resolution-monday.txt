A bipartisan House coalition is prepping a resolution that would either get Congress to sign off on intervention in Libya or cut off the operation. "We're prepared to move forward on the resolution on Monday," Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D-Ohio, told Fox News. 

A number of lawmakers, from both sides of the aisle, are concerned about operations in Libya without a formal declaration of war or any blessing from Congress that authorizes the involvement of U.S. forces. There is concern that the president may not be in compliance with the War Powers Act of 1973. 

No such resolution appears to be forthcoming in the Senate, though Rand Paul , R-Ky., and five other GOP senators, sent a letter to President Obama Thursday night asking if he intends to comply with the requirements of the War Powers Act to terminate U.S. military involvement in Libya in the next 30 days.
