The first election ad blasting some Democratic delegates for not wanting to include God in their party's platform has surfaced. 

Republican Rep. Allen West of Florida is attacking his Democratic opponent in a new web ad by seizing on the raucous fight Wednesday among delegates on the convention floor over including the word God in their platform. 

"Three times they said no to God," the on-screen text in the ad says. 

"That's Patrick Murphy's party," the ad says, referring to West's opponent in the upcoming congressional election. "Are those your values?" 

Following Wednesday's brief, but intense, floor flight, Democrats chose to put the word God back into the document. But that didn't stop West and his campaign from using it to their advantage as they head into a battle for votes in the race for Florida's 22nd Congressional district.
