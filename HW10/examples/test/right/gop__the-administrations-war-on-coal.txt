The Administration's War On Coal 



On Thursday, EPA Chief Lisa Jackson Encouraged College Activists To Campaign Against Coal.  "College environmental activists met Thursday with Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson to tell her what they re doing at their schools to try to shut down campus coal-fired heating plants. 'It s so important that your voices are heard, that campuses that are supposed to be teaching people aren t meanwhile polluting the surrounding community with mercury and costing the children a few IQ points because of the need to generate power. It s simply not fair,' Jackson said." (Renee Schoof, "EPA Chief Encourages College Activists In Campaign Against Coal,"  The Kansas City Star ,  10/27/11)
