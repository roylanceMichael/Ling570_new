MARQUETTE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Rick Santorum unveiled a final pitch to Michigan voters Sunday, saying the power to dramatically shake up the GOP race now rests in their hands. 

"We need to win this race on sharp, clear differences. On someone who can paint a very different vision of this country on the important issues of the day," Santorum said at a campaign rally here. 

"Well guess what, you have an opportunity to have a say about that," he continued. 

"You have an opportunity to vote and send a very clear and loud message. Particularly here in Michigan. You can set this race on its ear." 

The former senator also unloaded on Mitt Romney , accusing his rival of being a blatant hypocrite. 

"He supported the bailouts and now says oh I'm not for any more bailouts. Where's the credibility," Santorum asked. 

"He still supports No Child Left Behind , but he's criticizing me for voting for it and says I'm not a conservative because I voted for it and yet he supports it, he added. "The implementation of No Child Left Behind was horrendous. I oppose it. It was a mistake. I admit my mistakes. He doesn't." 

Romney is ahead of Santorum in Michigan according to an average of the latest polls. 

The senator is downplaying that poll position. 

"Your folks to the west in Minnesota helped a couple of weeks ago. They set this race in a whole new direction," Santorum told the crowd. 

"I'm hoping that you'll do the same."
