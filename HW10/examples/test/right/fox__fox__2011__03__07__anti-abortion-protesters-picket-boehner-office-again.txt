For the second time in two weeks, protersters picketed the offices of House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH). 

This protest was at Boehner's office in the Cincinnati suburb of West CHester. 

Late last month, U.S. Capitol Police six people affilated after they blocked the hall in front of one of Boehner's offices on Capitol Hill . 

The anti abortion group Operation Rescue, and others are demonstrating in an effort to get Congress to slash federal funding for Planned Parenthood . 

The "Hyde Amendment," approved annually by Congress for decades, bars the use of federal dollars for abortions. But there is great debate in Congress between supporters and opponents of the new health care law as to whether some federal dollars could be used for abortion services. Planned Parenthood performs abortions, but is banned from using federal dollars to pay for them. Anti-abortion groups applauded Congress in February when it passed a big spending bill to run the government this year that slashed federal support for Planned Parenthood for other procedures. 



Boehner has a long track record of opposing abortion
