Following Saturday's tragic shooting in Tucson that left Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords fighting for her life in an Arizona hospital room and five others dead, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) issued a blistering statement Sunday, sharply criticizing the pro-gun community. 

"Guns kill. And those who glamorize gunplay or worship gun ownership do no service to humanity," the statement read. 

It went on to say, "Democracy triumphs. The fundamental wisdom that has long distinguished our nation and has led her to greatness resides in our unwavering commitment to settle our differences with ballots, not bullets." 

Maloney acknowledged, "While it is too early to come to any conclusions about the causes or consequences of yesterday's tragic events, it is never too late to reflect on lessons we have learned from earlier such tragedies, and take them to heart." 

She added, "Words matter. And those who use inflammatory rhetoric to achieve cheap political gain wound our country and weaken the ties that bind us." 

Maloney's words are the strongest yet from any lawmaker since Saturday's incident. 

She ended her statement saying, "As we approach the observance of Martin Luther King Day , let us recall the words that Bobby Kennedy spoke on that tragic occasion so many years ago: Let us dedicate ourselves to what the Greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world.'"
