ABC's Jake Tapper:  "He ran a lot of commercials in 2008 about gas prices. It was a big part of his reelection campaign so I don't understand - there seems to be a tone of indignance from the White House about the fact that people are talking about gas prices - this is one of the reasons why you guys have your jobs." 



Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest:  "If I I I'm showing a sign of indignance maybe it's because I'm a little nervous in my first time. I'm not trying to demonstrate that there's some indignance up here " 



Tapper:  "I actually meant the President." 



Earnest:  "I appreciate that. It's very generous of you."
