COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa - Fresh off what an overwhelming consensus of viewers and pundits alike call a thrashing of President Obama in Wednesday night's debate, Vice President Joe Biden did his best to stop the bleeding. 

"You just never know what game - what position Governor Romney's going to come with," Biden told reporters before a rally in the battleground state of Iowa. 

"The centerpiece of their economic policy so far has been their tax cut and last night we found out he doesn't have a $5 trillion tax cut -- I guess he outsourced that to China or something." 

Biden's attacks continued and during a rally at the Mid-America Center in Council Bluffs, the vice president did what President Obama did not; go into full attack mode, and land some jabs of his own. 

"Governor Romney just stood there, and said bald-faced that we cut benefits and endangered Medicare . Folks, who do you think the American people are going to trust - Governor Romney or the AMA which endorsed what we did," Biden asked. 

After spouting off a laundry list of additional groups that supported the Administration's health care reforms, including the American Heart Association and the AARP, Biden let loose with this zinger. 

"The governor has to assume that the public is gonna have collective amnesia to take his word over those of us who spent out entire careers protecting and fighting for Medicare." 

The debate spotlight is now turning toward the running mates. For his part, Biden says he's confident, but not taking his Oct 11th match-up against Congressman Paul Ryan lightly. 

"I don't want to say anything in the debate that's not completely accurate," Biden said. 

"All debates are tough but I am looking forward to it. I really am. The thing about Congressman Ryan is he has been straight forward up to now about everything - all the significant changes he wants to make. We have a fundamentally different view on a whole range of issues. So I hope it will be a good debate," he added. 

Ryan meanwhile has been brushing up on briefing books and hunkered down in Virginia this week for debate camp. 

The congressman's campaign aides refer to Biden as "one of the most experienced debaters in American political life."
