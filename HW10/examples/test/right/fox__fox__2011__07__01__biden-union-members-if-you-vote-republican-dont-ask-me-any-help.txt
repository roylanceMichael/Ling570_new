Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged it wasn't a political event, but it still didn't prevent him from sending this warning to Teamsters union members during his address at their annual convention in Las Vegas this past Friday. 

"And don't any of you, by the way, any of you guys vote Republican," Biden said. "I'm not supposed to say, this isn't political. ...don't come to me if you do! You're on your own, Jack!" 

Biden provided the closing address at the 28th Annual International Brotherhood of Teamsters Convention at the Paris Hotel on Friday. The Vice President, who is known for his straightforward style, didn't hide his feelings about the current labor union fights across the country. He believes they are under attack by his Republican rivals for no apparent reason. 

"Look at Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Florida, Pennsylvania. Did you ever think in 2011 you would be fighting for the right to work for less again?," said Biden. "What in God's name did any organized labor union do to the collapse of this economy? ... [I]t's bizarre, but that's the case they're making." 

Republican governors in several states have sought to curb Union power in an effort to balance their state's budgets. 

Biden also jokingly took a jab at the GOP, suggesting they change their logo. 

"Jimmy," said Biden, referring to Teamsters Union president James R. Hoffa, "your (the Teamsters Union) logo is the horse's head. Their (GOP) logo should be the other horse's end." 

But when it came to discussing the importance of keeping collective bargaining for labor unions, Biden was in no laughing matter. 

"In their vision, you have no place at all. With our vision, you are the place!" said Biden. "We stand with you, organized labor, because with you we will restore the American dream." 

Biden's next trip will be to Chicago on Sunday, where he'll deliver a speech at the National Education Association's annual meeting.
