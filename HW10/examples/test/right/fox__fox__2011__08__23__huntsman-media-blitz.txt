Republican Jon Huntsman's campaign for president is touting a week long media blitz with several sit-down interviews. Overnight, the campaign unleashed a video and news release, "We were so pleased with his performance that we released the following web video titled, Take It From Me." The new video on You Tube pulls together highlights from Huntsman's recent media appearances in which he attacks President Obama. 

Huntsman's video follows the the Democratic Party which has also been making hay out of Huntsman's media splash. After his Sunday appearance on ABC's This Week, The Democratic National Committee (DNC) put up a blog post titled "Don't Take our Word For It - Jon Huntsman Slams His Republican Opponents ". The DNC introduced its own video montage of Huntsman's criticisms of Republican rivals with this: "We've been arguing for ages that Republicans are too extreme and that they have no new or serious ideas to get our economy moving again. But don't take our word for it - just ask GOP Presidential candidate Jon Huntsman." 

Huntsman took swipes on ABC at Mitt Romney for flip-flopping, as well as Texas Governor Rick Perry for his "treasonous" remark about Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. In the same interview, Huntsman said, "We have people on the Republican side too far to the right. We have zero substance. We have no good ideas that are being circulated...". 

Today, Huntsman who served as Obama's ambassador to China, put up this Tweet mentioning Democrats, "Got a kick out of your ad. But somehow you forgot my take on @BarackObama." Huntsman's Twitter account also blasted, "You better believe it wouldn't take me 2.5 years to sign a free trade agreement." The messages linked to a campaign's blog post on how Obama has "failed on trade." In it, Huntsman writes, "...the President still hasn't even submitted the free trade agreements to Congress" and "Other nations continue to reap the benefits of America's failure to act." 

A Monday night fundraising e-mail from Campaign Manager Matt David boasted, "In just the last five days, our campaign has experienced a huge surge in website traffic and more than 10,000 new followers on Twitter - far outpacing any other candidate - not to mention a record amount of online donations." David's e-mail refers to an headline grabbing Tweet from Huntsman last week which ran counter to competitor Governor Perry, "To be clear. I believe in evolution and trust scientists on global warming. Call me crazy." 

Despite the recent online buzz and success claimed by the campaign, the former governor of Utah still has work cut out from him. The latest average by Real Clear Politics on the race for the Republican Nomination shows Huntsman averaging 2.2 percent. Huntsman has Fox News Channel interviews airing Thursday (Neil Cavuto) and Saturday ( Mike Huckabee ).
