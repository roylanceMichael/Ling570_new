Republican Linda McMahon , the former wrestling executive who's mounting her second run for Senate in Connecticut , is currently leading Democratic Rep. Chris Murphy by 3 points, according to a new poll. 

The Quinnipiac University survey showed McMahon leading 49-46 percent. McMahon, fresh off a primary victory, is competing against Murphy for the seat being left by retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman . 

McMahon has high name ID after spending $50 million of her own money on her 2010 campaign against then-state Attorney General (and now Senator) Richard Blumenthal . 

The bombast of some of her campaign techniques in 2010 may have turned off some Connecticut voters, and McMahon has adjusted her tactics accordingly. She now spends more time discussing her life as a working mother and small (turned very, very large) businesswoman. 

Murphy probably has room to grow since according to this poll, 32 percent of the likely voters surveyed don't have enough information about him to form an opinion. 

Republicans say that Murphy is a weaker candidate than Blumenthal, who had a decades-long career in state government before running for the Senate. Republicans also like this race because McMahon has the capacity to largely go it alone when it comes to campaign financing. 

Democrats say that the same charges about her business career that dogged McMahon's previous bid will hurt her this time around as well. 

The poll of 1,472 likely voters was taken Aug. 22-26. The margin of error was 2.6 percentage points.
