The CIA will make photos of a deceased Usama bin Laden available to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Intelligence Committee, according to a Capitol Hill source who spoke to Fox News on the condition of anonymity. 

Members must travel to CIA headquarters to view the pictures that many have called "gruesome." Members have been directed to contact the CIA to arrange a time for a viewing. 

The message went out to Senate offices Tuesday. 

The House Intelligence Committee tells Fox News it will permit its members to travel to the CIA to look at the photos. The House Armed Services Committee has not said whether its members will go to CIA headquarters to view them. 

Fox News senior House producer Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
