House Republicans plan to take the first step towards overturning the health care overhaul law passed by the last Congress on Friday. They'll be discussing and voting on the terms of debate for bills to repeal and to "instruct the relevant committees" to formulate legislation to replace the so-called ObamaCare health plan. 

There will be some discussion about the contents of the repeal and replace bills, but much of the talk will be about how the measures arrived on the floor. 

Democrats say Republicans have already reneged on a campaign promise of increased openness in government by bringing up a bill for a vote without any hearings, any markups, and limited opportunities to amend the bill. 

The Republican defense will likely paraphrase a famous retort from former NBA all-star Allen Iverson , "Process? We're talkin' about process? Not the legislation. We're talkin' about process." House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has said that November's election results proved that the American public wanted Republicans to move quickly on the health care issue and that there was plenty of talk about the merits of the Democratic plan in the last session. 

The House vote will be largely symbolic though, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., told reporters Thursday that the Senate would not take up the repeal measure. 

In non-health care news, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies on the economy before the Senate Budget Committee at 9:30 a.m. ET. We expect Bernanke to get tough questions from committee members on raising the debt ceiling and his agency's "Quantitative Easing 2" strategy, which entails buying back $600 billion in Treasury securities in an effort to stimulate the economy.
