Haley Barbour has once again tapped into his extensive RNC network to recruit talent for his expected presidential launch. 

Fox News can confirm that the Mississippi governor has signed on James Richardson, who served as online communications manager for the RNC during the 2008 presidential race. Richardson is a contributing blogger for RedState, and has also written political commentary for Fox News, CBS News, the Washington Times, Politico, and the Daily Caller. 

Placing an emphasis on Richardson's online experience, Haley's Leadership PAC Chairman Henry Barbour issued a statement saying, "Haley is very pleased that James Richardson has joined his team to help manage the national interest of bloggers and other online journalists in the Governor's political activity. Haley understands the significant role bloggers play in today's political world and wants to maximize that dynamic medium."
