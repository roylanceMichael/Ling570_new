Some 2012 GOP presidential candidates were quick to react to the announcement from Atlanta businessman Herman Cain that he his suspending his campaign. Here is a look at their statements. 

" Herman Cain provided an important voice to this process. His ideas and energy generated tremendous enthusiasm for the conservative movement at a time it was so desperately needed to restore confidence in our country. I wish Herman, his wife Gloria, and his family all the best." 

-- Rep. Michele Bachmann 

"Herman Cain's 999 plan got our country talking about the critical issue of tax reform and he elevated the dialogue of the primary. I am proud to know Herman Cain and consider him a friend and I know he will continue to be a powerful voice for years to come." 

-- Newt Gingrich 

" Herman Cain offered a unique and valuable voice to the debate over how to reform our country's uncompetitive tax code and turn around the economy. I understand his decision and wish him and his family the best." 

-- Jon Huntsman 

"I know this was a difficult decision for Herman Cain , his family and his supporters. He helped invigorate conservative voters and our nation with a discussion of major tax reform. Anita and I wish him and his entire family all the best." 

-- Texas Gov. Rick Perry 

"I have no doubt Herman Cain will remain a significant voice in the dialogue about the many important issues we face. His rejection of business-as-usual in Washington has been a valuable part of this campaign, and clearly resonates with a great many Americans. I wish him the best." 

-- Gary Johnson 

Herman's campaign was one of ideas. His decision was based on what is best for him and his family. We wish Herman and Gloria the best. 

-- Mitt Romney 

Herman Cain brought energy and enthusiasm to the Republican nominating process, as well as a unique perspective on many domestic issues important to voters such as tax code reform and a pro-growth agenda favorable to the private sector. In light of his suspension of campaign activities, I want to wish Herman success in his future endeavors. 

-- Rep. Ron Paul
