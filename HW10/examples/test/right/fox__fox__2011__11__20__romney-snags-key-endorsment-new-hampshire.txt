On the same steps that JFK announced his presidential candidacy in 1960, Mitt Romney stood in front of Nashua City Hall and secured a key endorsement by first term New Hampshire Senator, Kelly Ayotte. 

"Mitt Romney has proven through his experience as a successful businessman, effective governor, and by his excellent presidential debate performances that he is best prepared to lead our country and ensure Barack Obama is a one-term president," Ayotte said. 

A Nashua native and former Attorney General in New Hampshire, Ayotte lauded Romney's heavy presence in the Granite State. 

"I have been impressed by the amount of time Mitt has spent in New Hampshire, holding open town hall meetings, answering the tough questions and listening to voters," she said. 

Ayotte's is the first of the Republican member of the congressional delegation in New Hampshire to back a candidate, and with Romney looking on, Ayotte, and her husband, promised to play an active role in Romney's campaign. 

"Joe and I will be doing everything we can to make sure Mitt Romney is the next president of the United States," she said. "We cannot take four more years of this president." 

Romney took to the podium to reciprocate his praise for the freshman Senator, calling her a conservative leader in the "fight to cut spending and create government that is more accountable to the taxpayer." 

He also took the opportunity to step up his criticism of President Obama, and what Romney characterizes as the President's "failed leadership" in trying to get the Super Committee to come to a consensus. 

"He has not taken personal responsibility to get the Super Committee to find ways to balance our budget and cut spending," he said. 

Instead, Romney says, President Obama "set a trap" with $454 billion in cuts to military spending at stake should the Super Committee fail. "We cannot put the United States security in jeopardy by the failure of this committee and the failure of his leadership."
