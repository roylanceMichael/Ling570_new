Wednesday will be the first day for the 112th Congress. 

The House and Senate will convene at 12:00 p.m. ET. 

After receiving the certificates of election from the states and taking an attendance vote, the House will start the process to select the next Speaker. Democrats will nominate Nancy Pelosi of California. Republicans will nominate Rep. John Boehner of Ohio. We expect all Republicans to vote for Boehner. We do not expect all Democrats to vote for Pelosi. Since there are more Republicans than Democrats participating in the vote, Boehner should win. 

Speaker-elect Boehner will then be introduced by Pelosi and deliver brief remarks to the members-elect in the chamber. 

Afterwards, the Dean of the House Caucus, Rep. John Dingell , D-Mich., will administer the oath of office to the Speaker-elect. Boehner, now House Speaker, will then administer the oath of office to the new members, who will each have an individual ceremonial swearing in just off the House Chamber. There will be lots of tears. 

Supporters from Boehner's home district arrived via bus from Ohio Wednesday evening and will watch a live feed of the ceremony from the nearby Cannon House Office Building. 

After the 112th Congress is sworn in, the new Majority Leader, Eric Cantor, R-Va., will call up the House rules package at approximately 2:30 p.m. ET. This document, if approved, will govern how the chamber will conduct its business for the next two years. 

The Senate will also swear in reelected and newly elected senators Wednesday afternoon at approximately 1:00p.m. ET. It should take about two hours to finish. They'll also select the majority and minority leaders. They should be the same as the previous Congress: Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 

The new leaders will then hold their weekly policy lunches, followed by back-to-back media availabilities at approximately 2:30 p.m. ET. 

Sen. Tom Udall , D-N.M., will introduce a resolution to open the Senate rules to allow for a change in the rule governing the use of the filibuster. Udall's argument rests on the presumption that the Senate is not a continuing body, but rather that the Constitution allows it to set its own rules. A former Senate Parliamentarian says that a maneuver like this has never been attempted before.
