The Tea Party activist group FreedomWorks has issued what they're calling a Key Vote "NO" letter' to all members of the U.S. House of Representatives, urging them to vote against the revised Boehner bill, which attempts to avoid crisis by reducing the deficit and raising the debt ceiling. 

The letter says the House Speaker's plan "still fails to fundamentally change the way Washington spends. Anything less than that, FreedomWorks cannot and will not support." 

FreedomWorks instead pushes Republican lawmakers to stick to the "Cut, Cap and Balance' bill passed in the House earlier this month. "We will be engaging our activist network of over 1.4 million grassroots volunteers... to remind Speaker Boehner and the rest of the Republican establishment that the "Cut, Cap, and Balance Act' is both good politics and good policy." 

Cut, Cap and Balance' is widely seen as dead on arrival in the Senate where there are only 47 Republican Senators. 

The letter also details the efforts of FreedomWorks this week to kill the Boehner bill, including organizing phone call and email blitzes to strategic House offices, along with visits to congressional offices in Washington and out in the districts. 

"The Republicans are essentially negotiating with themselves at this point," said Matt Kibbe, President of FreedomWorks. "Compromise is something that involves both sides in a dispute. So far, only one side has put forward a plan that is transparent, debated, and passed by the House of Representatives. Your move, Senator Reid."
