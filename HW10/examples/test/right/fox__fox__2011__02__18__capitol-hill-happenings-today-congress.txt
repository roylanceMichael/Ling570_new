The House meets at 9:00 a.m. ET to continue what has been a week of long nights debating a bill to fund the government for the next seven months. 

We should see many more votes on amendments to the proposal as Democrats and Republicans attempt to cut and redistribute funds from the overall deal. One of the first amendments to get considered on Thursday could be an effort from Rep. Danny Rehberg, R-Mont., to remove all funding for the implementation of the health care law for the rest of the fiscal year. 

The office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., tells Fox News that it is their "hope" to finish the spending bill on Friday, but it is looking increasingly likely that the final vote could slide into Saturday. 

The current temporary bill expires on March 4, but members of the House and Senate will be in their home districts next week for the President's Day recess. That leaves them with only five working days to come to an agreement and avoid a government shutdown. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Thursday that the House would not move a short-term budget bill if the two chambers cannot agree on a final product by the March deadline.
