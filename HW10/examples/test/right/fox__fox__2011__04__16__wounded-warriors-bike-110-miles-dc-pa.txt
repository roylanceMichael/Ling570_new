Air Force Tech Sergeant Chris Frost says when he's riding most people notice his specialized, three-wheeled bike before they notice he's missing both of his legs below the knee. 

"A bicycle is freedom. You can see a lot more ground, you can get around a lot more... it's basically your mobility," says the Iraq War veteran. 

This weekend, Frost will pedal 110 miles from Washington, D.C. to Gettysburg, Penn. alongside approximately 90 other wounded warriors with the World Team Sports "Face of America" Ride. 

All this is happening less than three years after an IED turned his world upside down. 

"I was deployed to Iraq and there was a large roadside bomb that was actually in the middle of the road, that blew up under our truck," Frost recalls. "I immediately lost my right leg below the knee, and then I had severe injuries to my left leg, which we tried to save for about two and a half years and we actually just took off last fall." 

Frost doesn't just set an example for airmen everywhere on his bicycle, he also represents them on Capitol Hill from time to time, at the request of his superiors, particularly when it comes time to let lawmakers know how important taking care of disabled servicemen and women is. 

"We have many airmen that are severely injured from these wars, and we want to continue that care of lifetime support to both the military member and their families, and that's what we want to highlight with Chris," says Chief Master Sergeant James Roy, the Air Force's top enlisted officer. 

Sgt. Frost's story is certainly an inspiration, as are dozens of his fellow cyclists this weekend, who are pedaling on, in spite of very wet weather in the forecast.
