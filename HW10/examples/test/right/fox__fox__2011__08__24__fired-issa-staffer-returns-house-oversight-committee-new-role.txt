Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman for House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa , R-Calif., has returned in a new role as a committee staffer. 

Issa fired Bardella in early March after it was found he had been leaking email exchanges between himself and reporters to New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich. 

In the interim, Bardella has been working as a spokesman for the online publication The Daily Caller. 

"Kurt Bardella has accepted a position as a Professional Staff Member with the Oversight Committee," Issa spokesman Frederick Hill said in a statement. "He will work under the committee's General Counsel and not as a spokesman or taking media inquiries."
