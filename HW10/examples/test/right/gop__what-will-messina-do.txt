What will Messina do? 



As we near the end of the Democrats' chaotic convention, a look at the obstacles the Obama campaign faces in North Carolina as well as the economic realities in a state they won by just 14,000 votes in 2008 makes you wonder - will Team Obama still be in North Carolina next week? 



Associated Press: Obama faces obstacles in holding North Carolina
