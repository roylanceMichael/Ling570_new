CPAC presidential straw poll results aside, Karl Rove , former Senior Adviser to President George W. Bush says the GOP side of the 2012 presidential field is "a wide open contest." Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Rove classified the race as "the first Republican contest in modern history in which there is no presumptive frontrunner." While Rove doesn't currently see a clear cut choice for the GOP, he did admit the nominee is likely to be a better known name, naming several examples including "Governor Romney, Sarah Palin and Governors Barbour, Daniels and Pawlenty." 

When asked how high profile political departures in Congress could impact both parties during the next election, Rove said he was "surprised" by Senator John Kyl's (R-Ariz.) announcement that he would not seek another term in office. As Senate Minority Whip, Rove said Kyl is "important not simply to Republicans but to the functioning of the Senate" and "a thoughtful person respected on both sides of the aisle." Citing the announcement of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison's retirement (R-Texas), Rove said "Democrats have no candidate in Texas" and forecast a similar predicament for Democrats in Virginia, in the wake of Senator Jim Webb's (D-Va.) announcement that he too would not seek re-election. 

In addition to Kyl, Webb and Hutchison, Senators Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) have also announced they will retire at the beginning of 2013.
