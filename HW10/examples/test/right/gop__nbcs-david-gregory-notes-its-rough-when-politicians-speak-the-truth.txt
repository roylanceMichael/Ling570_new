NBC's David Gregory Notes It's Rough When Politicians Speak The Truth 





NBC's David Gregory: " I think in the case of Biden, I think, he certainly knew what the President's views were and he knew certainly what his views were. He was asked a direct question and he gave a direct answer and, I think, in the process of giving that answer he went farther than he intended to. I certainly don't think it was a plant in that respect or something he intended to do. And I think with Cory Booker, look, I think Booker, yes he's supportive of the President but I think he's also positioning himself as a more centrist, pragmatic leader and wants to take on some of the excesses in this advertising. He said exactly what he meant. I think what's, and I think Joe made this point over the course of the week, what always is, I think, more hurtful to these figures is if they, you know, really try to walk this stuff  back, as if they were in some sort of daze when they originally said it. I mean, Cory Booker was passionate. He was very clear, declarative. He knew what he believed on that." (MSNBC's "Morning Joe," 5/25/12)
