President Obama is expected to announce Monday that Army General Martin Dempsey will be he pick for the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 

A notice from the White House says the president will talk about the move from the Rose Garden Monday morning, which is also Memorial Day. 

If confirmed by the Senate, Dempsey would take over for Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, whose term is ending. 

Dempsey just started his role as Army chief in April. His new post would break a recent string of Joint Chiefs chairmen hailing from non-Army branches. 

Dempsey's expected nomination comes among other moves in the Department of Defense and CIA. 

Obama just this week sent his nominations to the Senate for General David Petraeus to head the CIA and Leon Panetta for Defense Secretary. 

Current Secretary Robert Gates is leaving after starting his tenure serving under former President George W. Bush.
