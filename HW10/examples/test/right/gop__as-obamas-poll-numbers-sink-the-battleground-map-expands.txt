MSNBC's Chuck Todd:  "Today, this morning, it's the new NBC News battleground map. The bottom line: the presidential contest is shaping up to be very competitive and potentially very close. Think 2004 meets 2000, but with the 2008 states. And our year out map shows the toll this summer has taken on the president. Since we rolled out the last NBC News battleground map in April, five states have shifted towards the republicans including Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are now in our toss up column.  Altogether the election will likely come down to these eleven toss up states. They fall roughly into three regions. The Midwest/Rust Belt, the new south and the west. So take a look at them here. You've got your Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, making up the Rust Belt, Wisconsin, Iowa, more of the agricultural Midwest. Then Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico out west, and those new south states of Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. Remember, ultimately the presidential contest is a game of math and in the race to 270, democrats have lost ground since April. Democrats now have 196 electoral votes in their column, if you combine our leans, likely, and solids. Republicans have 195 and 147 electoral votes are considered a toss up. In April it was 232 electoral votes in some shade of blue. The quickest way now for the president to find the 74 electoral votes he would need in our battleground map is as follows: Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Colorado gets him to 272. Now, what s the quickest way for him to get to 270 without Florida and Ohio. Well, he would have to win Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia - excuse me, Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, Iowa and New Mexico. So, that s the whole point of the Obama strategy, which is to have different paths to 270 that would avoid them having to camp out in Florida or Ohio." (MSNBC's  "The Daily Rundown,"  11/7/11)
