IS THIS THE MESSENGER OBAMA WANTS? 



The Obama Campaign Has Biden Campaigning In Swing States Where Obama Struggles 

Last November, The Obama Campaign Began "Crafting A Campaign Strategy For Vice President Joe Biden" To Campaign In Ohio, Pennsylvania, And Florida" Because He "Might Be More Of An Asset To President Barack Obama's Re-Election Campaign Than The President Himself."  "A year from Election Day, Democrats are crafting a campaign strategy for Vice President Joe Biden that targets the big three political battlegrounds: Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Florida, states where Biden might be more of an asset to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign than the president himself." ("Obama 2012 Campaign: Joe Biden Targets Ohio, Pennsylvania And Florida,"  The Associated Press , 11/25/12) 

Biden Has Been Tasked As The Obama Campaign's "Natural Ambassador To Woo Back Working-Class Voters."  "The vice president's blue-collar upbringing and plainspoken style make him a natural ambassador to woo back working-class voters who supported Obama in 2008 but are still struggling in the fragile U.S. economy." (Oliver Knox, "Biden Blasts Republicans As Obama Reelection Drive Revs Up," Yahoo News'  "The Ticket,"  3/15/12) Biden Is "Expected To Campaign Heavily In States Like Ohio, Pennsylvania And Michigan" To "Appeal To Blue-Collar Voters."  "He is expected to campaign heavily in states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- where he would appeal to blue-collar voters -- and where he could play the attack dog role against the eventual GOP nominee." (Daniel Strauss, "Biden Reelection Team,"  The Hill,  3/26/12)
