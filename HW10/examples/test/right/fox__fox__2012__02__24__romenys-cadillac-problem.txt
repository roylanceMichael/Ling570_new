Mitt Romney loves American cars. 

It's just how many he drives that might cause him a headache. 

In an attempt to show his dedication to the US auto industry and his Michigan roots, Mr Romney let slip that he owns four cars, including "a couple" of Cadillacs driven by his wife. 

"I drive a Mustang and Chevy pickup truck," he said while delivering a major economic speech to the Detroit Economic Club. "Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs actually. I used to have a Dodge truck so I used to have all 3 covered." 

The off-script comment from the usually well-scripted candidate shifted focus away from his economic message, and onto Romney's wealth, a topic the campaign has repeatedly tried to play down. And for a man accused of being out of touch with everyday voters, his casual reference to owning multiple luxury cars only adds to that image. 

A campaign spokesperson said after the event that Mrs. Romney owns two Cadillac SRXs, a luxury crossover SUV made by General Motors. The sticker price starts at just over $35,000 and tops out at just under $55,000 according to Cadillac's website. 

The venue for today's speech - Ford Field , a stadium that seats more than 65,000 - only added to the day's awkwardness. The speech was moved there after the original venue became too small. But for a campaign focused on displaying a certain image, the empty space provided a jarring image, dwarfing the 1,200 attendees and muting any applause during his speech.
