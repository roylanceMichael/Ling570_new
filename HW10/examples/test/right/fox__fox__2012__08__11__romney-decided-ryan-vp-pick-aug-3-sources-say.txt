Mitt Romney told a top aide that he had selected Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate on Aug. 1, sources tell Fox News. 

The Republican presidential candidate notified Beth Myers, who was running his VP search, and called up Ryan that day to set up a meeting. 

It's unclear when exactly Romney made the formal offer to Ryan. 

The campaign did not confirm the selection publicly until Saturday morning. 

Romney is formally announcing his decision at a campaign stop in Virginia .
