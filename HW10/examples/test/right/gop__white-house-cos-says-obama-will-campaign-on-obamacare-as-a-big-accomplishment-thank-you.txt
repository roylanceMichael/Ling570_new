White House COS Says Obama Will Campaign On Obamacare As A "Big Accomplishment" (Thank You!) 





NBC's David Gregory:  "Is this an issue that the President will campaign on?" 

White House Chief Of Staff Jack Lew:  "I think the Affordable Care Act is something that is a big accomplishment and he will be campaigning on that. I think the right of women to all forms of preventive health care is an important part of it." (NBC's "Meet The Press," 2/12/12) So What Has ObamaCare Accomplished?  



Rising Health Care Spending 

CBO: The Aging Population And Rising Health Care Costs Will Increase Federal Debt To Unsupportable Levels.   Under both CBO s baseline and its alternative fiscal scenario, the aging of the population and rising costs for health care will push spending for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs considerably higher as a percentage of GDP. If that rising level of spending is coupled with revenues that are held close to the average share of GDP that they have represented for the past 40 years (rather than being allowed to increase, as under current law), the resulting deficits will increase federal debt to unsupportable levels. (The Budget And Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 To 2022,  Congressional Budget Office , 1/31/12) CBO: Federal Health Care Spending Will Double To $1.8 Trillion Over The Next Decade.  "The cost of government healthcare programs will more than double over the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday. CBO's economic outlook predicts that federal spending on Medicare, Medicaid and other healthcare programs will climb to $1.8 trillion -- or about 7 percent of the entire economy -- by 2022." (Sam Baker, "CBO Expects Health Spending To Double,"  The Hill , 1/31/12)  

Increased Premiums For Families And Businesses 

FactCheck.org: ObamaCare Is Actually Making Health Care "Less Affordable."  "At the moment, the new law is making health care slightly less affordable. Independent health care experts say the law has caused some insurance premiums to rise. As we wrote in October, the new law has caused about a 1 percent to 3 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employer-sponsored family plans because of requirements for increased benefits. Last year's premium increases cast even more doubt on another promise the president has made -- that the health care law would 'lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year.'" (D'Angelo Gore, "Promises, Promises,"  FactCheck.org , 1/4/12) 

Spending On Health Coverage For Workers "Spiked" 9 Percent In 2011.  "Employers spending on health coverage for workers spiked abruptly this year, with the average cost of a family plan rising by 9 percent, triple the growth seen in 2010." (Julie Appleby, "Cost Of Employer Insurance Plans Surge In 2011,"  Kaiser Health News , 9/27/11) Costs Of Family Coverage "Climbed" 9 Percent In 2011.  "The average cost of a family policy climbed 9 percent in 2011 to $15,073, according to a poll of 2,088 private companies and state and local government agencies by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, California, and the Chicago- based American Hospital Association's Health Research and Educational Trust." (Jeffrey Young, "Health-Benefit Costs Rise Most In Six Years,"  Bloomberg , 9/27/11) 

Increased National Debt 

CBO Reported That An "Explosion" In Health Care Spending, Including New Costs In ObamaCare, Will Drive The National Debt Higher.  "Over the long term, the CBO said, the debt will be driven by a projected explosion in spending linked entirely to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as 'insurance subsidies' that are intended to help cover the uninsured under President Obama's new health-care law." (Rosalind S. Helderman Lori Montgomery, "Congressional Leaders Increase Pressure On Group Discussing Debt-Reduction Deal,"  The Washington Post ,  6/22/11)                             

And A Mandate On Religious Organization to Compromise Their Consciences 

The Obama Administration Mandated That Contraception Be Covered By Insurance Plans And Rejected An Exemption For Religious Organizations That Don't Offer Contraception Due To Religious Beliefs.  "The Obama administration said Friday that most health insurance plans must cover contraceptives for women free of charge, and it rejected a broad exemption sought by the Roman Catholic Church for insurance provided to employees of Catholic hospitals, colleges and charities." (Robert Pear, "Obama Reaffirms Insurers Must Cover Contraception,"  The New York Times , 1/20/12)
