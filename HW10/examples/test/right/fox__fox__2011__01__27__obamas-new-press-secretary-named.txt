President Obama's inner circle has undergone some structural changes which his new Chief of Staff Bill Daley says, "...will bring greater clarity to our structure and roles and will enhance coordination and collaboration among us." 

First off, the White House announced its new public face will be Jay Carney, who will be replacing outgoing Robert Gibbs as Press Secretary. Carney is currently Vice President Biden's Communications Director. Gibbs recently announced he'd be leaving his post after a more than two-year stint to become a private sector consultant for the president's re-election campaign. 

Nancy-Ann DeParle, who had been in charge of health policy at the White House ; a position referred to by outsiders as the "Health Czar"; has moved to Daley's office. DeParle's new title is: 'Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy'. 

Rob Nabors will become the new Director of Legislative Affairs, replacing Phil Schiliro, who is leaving the White House . 

Daley told his staff, "Some of you may have heard that Phil Schiliro's intention was to leave the White House at the end of the last Congress. Phil has made extraordinary contributions to the President's success, and I've asked him to slow his departure in order to lend his wise counsel and guidance in the transition period ahead." 

Relations with the new GOP-led House will be key in the months ahead as some members work to repeal the president's signature health care bill. Carney, who is a familiar face to the Washington media circuit, has plenty of experience in front of the camera. Before joining Vice President Biden's office, Carney was Washington Bureau Chief for Time Magazine and did regular TV interviews. He left his two-decade old career at Time to join the vice president's team during the 2008 transition. Sources say the vice president himself pushed hard for Carney to get the job as spokesman. 

Sources also say Carney impressed President Obama, new Chief of Staff Bill Daley, and Senior Advisor David Plouffe during the interview process; with one source noting he "hit it out of the park." Additionally, "several candidates actually increased their stature in here during the process," says a senior White House official. Among the known candidates were Deputy Press Secretaries Bill Burton and Josh Earnest, Deputy Communications Director Jen Psaki, and Former DNC spokesperson Karen Finney. 

Stephanie Cutter, who is handling communications related to the Health Care law, was also believed to be a potential candidate. Cutter has been elevated to Assistant to the President and Deputy Senior Advisor'. 

A coy Robert Gibbs had been eluding to an imminent announcement on his own replacement, telling reporters his stint was nearing an end. Gibbs plans to leave his post in mid-February.Daley described his thinking behind the staffing changes this way: "My mission is to get the most out of the great talent that President Obama has brought to the White House so that we can all help him effectively serve and lead the American people."
