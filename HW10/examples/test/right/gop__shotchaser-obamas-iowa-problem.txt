SHOT/CHASER: Obama's Iowa Problem 



If President Obama's TV ad buy in Iowa tells us anything, it's that the Obama Campaign is panicking in a state he carried by nearly 10 points in 2008.  From rising gas prices, to dipping poll numbers, and voters fleeing the Iowa Democratic Party, Obama is in deep trouble in Iowa and his campaign clearly knows it.  

Back in January, DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Shultz claimed Obama had the strongest organization in Iowa, but yesterday's voter registration numbers show that either his organization isn't so strong after all, or more likely, Iowans know they can't afford four more years of President Obama.  Four years ago Barack Obama launched his campaign to "change Washington" in Iowa; today as he resorts to cynical, misleading attack ads, it is clear to Iowans that it was just phony rhetoric and they are ready for real solutions.
