Stimulus II: Not Going To Work 



As President Obama's approval numbers plummet, the  Democratic National Committee is trying to save his reelection hopes with a new television ad  airing in states the president carried in 2008. Out of ideas to fix the economy, President Obama held the country and Congress captive for yet another speech to trot out a new $447 billion stimulus that doubles down on his failed policies.  After failing to create a single job last month, Democrats are going to need a lot more than TV ads to convince voters to support more of the same ineffective policies that have failed to put our country back to work. 



STIMULUS II: NOT GOING TO WORK  

The New York Times Motoko Rich:  "The dismal state of the economy is the main reason many companies are reluctant to hire workers, and few executives are saying that President Obama's jobs plan -- while welcome -- will change their minds any time soon.  That sentiment was echoed across numerous industries by executives in companies big and small on Friday, underscoring the challenge for the Obama administration as it tries to encourage hiring and perk up the moribund economy. The plan failed to generate any optimism on Wall Street as the Standard Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average each fell about 2.7 percent."

The Economist's Will Wilkinson:  "Notice what Obama s not claiming passing this bill will do: stimulate growth or significantly reduce the unemployment rate." (Will Wilkinson,  Twitter Feed , Accessed 9/9/11) 

Jason Fichtner, Policy Researcher At The Mercatus Center:   'The infrastructure bank model that is being promoted by President Obama is all smoke and mirrors and continues to funnel taxpayer dollars to fund projects in a vain attempt to stimulate the economy in the short term without accounting for the long-term costs,' Jason Fichtner, a policy researcher at George Mason University s Mercatus Center, said in a statement."

Time's Adam   Sorensen:  "The effects of Obama's speech -- and his plan -- will be limited. Some of his proposals, already in place in some form this year, haven't prevented the recovery from grinding to a halt."
