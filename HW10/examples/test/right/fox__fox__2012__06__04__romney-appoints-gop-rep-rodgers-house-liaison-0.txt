Mitt Romney has appointed Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers , R-Wash., the highest-ranking female Republican in Congress, to serve as his campaign's liaison to the House. 

In an announcement Monday, the Romney campaign said that McMorris Rodgers, the vice chair of the House GOP conference, will team up with Sen. Roy Blunt , R-Mo., who serves as the Republican presidential candidate's chief surrogate in the Senate. 

"She understands the impact of the economic challenges Americans face and the need to put our country on a better track. As a member of the leadership team in the House, she will be a helpful partner in our efforts to ensure our focus remains on the critical issue of economic security for all Americans," Romney said. 

McMorris Rodgers already serves as Romney's campaign co-chairwoman in Washington state. She's also slated to host a fundraiser with Romney in her home state. 

"I look forward to working with the campaign, Senator Blunt, and leaders across the country in our effort to get our country back on the right track," McMorris Rodgers said. 

McMorris Rodgers first won election to the House in 2004. The House GOP elected her to vice chair of the conference in 2009.
