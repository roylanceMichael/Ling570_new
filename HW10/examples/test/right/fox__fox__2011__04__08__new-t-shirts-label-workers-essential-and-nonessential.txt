In light of the potential government shutdown, federal workers are having to come to grips with the idea of being "essential" or "non-essential." And now a t-shirt website gives them a way to wear their new labels on their sleeves. 

For $17 dollars, federal workers can buy a t-shirt that labels them "officially essential 2011" or "officially nonessential 2011." 

The shirts come in men's and women's sizes and a variety of colors. They also come customized in House of Representatives and Senate versions as well as many federal departments and agencies.
