On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Mitt Romney pegged Rick Santorum as "press secretary" in a friendly game of word association. 

The banter began when Leno teased Romney for saying he hadn't made a list regarding potential Vice Presidential picks, arguing it would be "presumptuous." 

"I am not even running, and I have made a list," Leno joked. 

The late night talk show host proceeded to ask Romney to offer one word answers to describe several prominent Republicans. Romney's answers drew large laughs from the crowd. 

He called Chris Christie "indomitable," Paul Ryan "creative," Nikki Haley "energetic," Donald Trump "huge," and Rick Santorum "press secretary." 

The swipe was seemingly aimed at Santorum's recent profanity-laced outburst on the press at an event in Wisconsin. But it wasn't all laughs for Romney on the show. 

Leno grilled the Presidential candidate on various issues including Obama's controversial healthcare law presently being heard in the U.S. Supreme Court. Romney vowed again to repeal and replace ObamaCare. 

The host pressed Romney on the issue of coverage for children and pre-existing conditions. The former Massachusetts governor said people who have been "continuously" insured would not be penalized. 

"People with pre-existing conditions, as long as they have been insured before, they are going to be able to continue to have insurance," Romney explained. 

He also said that exceptions would be made based on circumstances; however people who hold off buying insurance until falling ill would not be covered. 

"If they are 45 years old and they show up and say I want insurance because I have heart disease, it's like, hey guys. We can't play the game like that," Romney argued.
